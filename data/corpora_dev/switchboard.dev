Uh-huh.
So. I always thought that was kind of weird.
Yeah,
it's funny how we, uh, we, we romanticize people
Uh-huh.
like, for instance, where as the teenager, you know, you romance a, romanticize a rock star,
but when he gets married, then you don't care any more or something like that,
Um, right.
and I think it's the same with your characters on T V.
Do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret, or at least they keep it quiet.
Probably,
yeah
I mean,
I know it affected me when I was younger.
I'm not into rock stars too much lately,
Yeah.
but
No,
like Madonna and Sean Penn.
Now I don't particularly like either one of them
Uh-huh.
but, um, uh, their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together
Yeah.
or at least, that's the way I look at it.
Uh-huh
So I don't know,
it would have been hard,
wouldn't it.
Yeah,
I would think so.
I just, the, the publicity in and of itself, much less the, I mean,
when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place,
so, having twenty million people watch you do that
Yeah,
it's,
they wouldn't be easy.
Yeah.
So, um, well that's kind of interesting.
Yeah.
So, um, well I guess that's about all we need to do, isn't it.
Yeah,
I think we've covered our time.
It's been good talking to you.
Yeah,
it has been, Becky,
I really appreciate it.
You're the first man I've talked to,
everyone else has been a female,
so this is a change.
Well, I think I've, um,
you're the second female I've talked to.
You've had a little bit of variety, huh.
Yeah,
it's kind of nice
Okay
well, thanks so much.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Well like I was saying, Burlington's crime, it doesn't involve children
and, what you see on the T V from, you know, in Washington and New York.
So what I believe the people want,
the subject is, is big city crime, which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about,
but I have, you know, concerns,
and I have a few ideas of, um, how to combat it.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I don't, I don't think, ideally, you know, you need money to do everything
so That's one thing
Uh-huh.
that, that's, that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money.
So.
Right,
yeah,
well, when, uh, we lived in San Antonio,
I grew up around San Antonio,
and it's always been a very large, uh, city, and increasingly growing.
It's has kind of the split population.
Um, there's a lot of retired military, uh, individuals that live there,
and then there's a very large Hispanic population there.
And the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic, uh, gang crime in the city
Oh,
and that has, uh, been the worse thing that we've seen happening.
Does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the, uh, retired people's community,
or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods?
Um, the majority of the actual gang crimes, like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods,
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies, rape and, uh, car crime.
There's a very large, uh, or very high percentage of car theft.
And San San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico,
so a lot of the, uh, cars go to, uh, you know, shops,
and they take them apart,
and a lot of them go over the border, especially like Mercedes.
A lot of those, those in the, the Z, uh, the Z cars, the Datsun cars end up over the border,
and uh
So that's a big concern if you live there,  is to really lock your car up .
very much so,
very much so,
in fact, for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light, they had a rash of where people were, when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up.
So now, ever since then, when you drive into the city, most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car, until they get down there,
and once you've reached the, the river walk area, which is the tourist area, it's usually pretty safe during the day, if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys, and, um, you know, or alone.
If you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops, it's very nice.
But at, at evening, um, again, you, they have the high tourist area, the river walk area, which is nice,
but you don't want to get off the beaten track.
Um, there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight.
And so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage, uh, alone.
Oh, my, it sounds like, um, San Juan, Puerto Rico,
we were there just, well for a lay over
Uh-huh.
and, um, well, it wasn't a lay over,
we were, we had, we were staying at the other end of the island,
and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane.
Uh-huh.
It was at night,
and this boy really wanted to go on the beach,
and they look at you crazy
Uh-huh.
you don't go on the beach.
Uh-huh.
Well, it's a big tourist town, you know,
don't they, don't people go for a walk on the beach at night?
And they said, no,
it's very safe in the daytime
Uh-huh.
but at night, they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens, pretty much telling people, be wary, you know, and get off the beach.
It's just so sad, you know,
it is just really so sad, you know,
it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more.
Um, in San Antonio I don't know what the answer is.
Education, I think, is a lot of it.
Um, so many of the kids are drop outs.
Um, uh, there's a lot of drugs that go on, and that they just have hopeless lives.
They, they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels.
I think education helps a little bit there.
Um, then again, I don't know really what steps there are that they,
Well, what they, what they say they try to do is to get the kids, um, early and young.
Uh-huh.
And what we have here in Burlington, which it doesn't cost a lot of money, but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
They set up kids with elderly people, in the winter time they shovel their snow.
They have a big brother, big sister program.
They have bottle drives,
they have cleanup outings.
And they have also organized fun activities like gyms, going to the beach, and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer,
and they have gyms open.
And it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school, you might keep them
Uh-huh.
but you, again, you need that one on one like a big brother, trying to keep the younger kid, you know, tell him, hey stay in school,
it'll get better, you know,
so that your mom doesn't have a job
Uh-huh.
and she doesn't work,
you don't know,
you can be better than that.
You don't have to live on the, you know, for a street life.
Uh-huh.
But.
Uh-huh,
that's good, that sounds like they've got a lot going on there.
Yeah,
but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here.
I mean, um, they can deal with that scale.
Uh-huh.
They might have five hundred troubled youths.
Uh-huh.
When you have five thousand troubled youths, plus when you're getting into well, the kids now, it's twelve years old
and they're selling drugs
Uh-huh.
and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's just, it's the morals of the people which, I mean, I guess we, everybody's responsible for the society,
but, if I had a child that, that did things so bad,
it's not, they don't care about anybody
Uh-huh.
these people they're stealing from, they're just the big bad rich guy
Uh-huh.
and we don't have it,
so we deserve it,
and we should take it.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
I don't know how you combat that.
I, I don't know where you start or, with a lot of these kids,
um, so many of them, all they see is just the gangs
Yes.
and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school.
Well, I think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible, too.
We're talking these kids are fourteen years old.
Oh yeah.
The parents might be thirty years old
Uh-huh.
and I'm thirty years old,
and I'm kind of irresponsible,
but I have the morals that keep me from, you know,
if I was going to go out and drink or do something, I wouldn't do it in front of my child.
These people, you know, they bring their, their Johns home
and they bring their drugs home
and the kids are just sitting there in the same room.
Uh-huh.
It's just that they have absolutely no, no morals
Uh-huh.
and it's really sad.
And I don't know how you combat that.
I
I don't know what the answer is to that problem, you know.
But I like your idea of education
Uh-huh
I mean if the parents aren't supplying it, they've got to get it from someone else from the schools,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
And what do those kids do,
they get it at school and come home,
what do they do then.
I, I feel, I feel for them,
I don't know how to make it better for them
or, you know, because it, they can't remove themselves,
they can't just leave and say okay, well, it's not acceptable,
I'm leaving the big city, Mom,
and I'm, I'm going off, you know,
when they're ten, they have to live in it,
Yeah,
it's really sad,
like if they did have a big brother, big sister program
those, those people trying to help the kids,
the parents might have hostilities towards them, you know, Like you're judging us,
Right,
I think so,
and uh,
and I'm not good enough to raise my child, which basically is true
Uh-huh.
It's, it's, it's,
I'm glad I don't live in a big city just because, I mean, not just because I wouldn't feel safe,
Uh-huh,
yeah,
it's just because that I would be reminded every day of something that I don't see,
Yeah.
and I might see it on a, you know, a SIXTY MINUTES special.
Uh-huh,
no,
in San Antonio it was like every day,
it was just a matter of who was shot that night,
I know it
but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city, believe it or not
I mean, they have all kinds of nice write ups about it
Uh-huh,
oh, yeah,
but, But there's a lot of them,
but any big city has a bad section.
it's very prevalent,
a lot of the crime is very prevalent.
Yes,
they're very bold it seems.
Uh-huh,
very much.
When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change, because it's such a small community,
we're just above Carmel,
and, um, there's hardly,
most everybody seems pretty well employed around here,
and um, those that aren't,
there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive, which is mostly migrant workers,
and there's a lot of crime there, um, migrant Hispanic farm workers, people that are down and out,
and uh, they all seem to congregate in Celinas, not so much here in Monterrey.
So, it's, it's pretty quiet. You know,
we walk the streets at night,
and, uh, people run in the park,
and you know, you're just,
have your normal smarts about you, then you really don't have to worry,
or,
Really,
even, uh, even in the worst crime areas in Burlington,
I, I can walk the streets.
I wouldn't,
I, if I did it every night I think there would be trouble in our house,
Uh-huh.
so you wouldn't get confronted or anything
Right.
but I don't think you would, uh,
someone might grab you, mess around with you,
but they're not going to grab you, steal your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I mean that's what you, your going to have to expect that to happen.
People are just totally unfeeling.
Uh-huh, uh,
I didn't know that about Burlington,
I'll have to keep that in mind
Okay, uh,
let's see,
I, I believe in the trial by jury.
I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for, uh, payoffs, you know, briberies, uh, unfairness, one-sidedness, you know, all those kinds of things.
And I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict somebody.
I, I really agree with the, uh, innocent until proven guilty theory.
I think that's, that's a good way to do it.
That's about all.
Well, I think, I think basically we're in a lot of agreement, uh, in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, uh, some kind of legal definition.
Uh-huh.
But for anything involving that, trial by jury certainly should be mandatory.
Uh-huh
But there should be with our overworked, uh, judicial system,
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of, of, um, not having to take everything before a full court. You know,
maybe there ought to be some kind of, of, uh,
isn't there a type of word called a jury duty now.
Uh-huh.
Really.
And maybe instead of, of, uh, just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit to spend a week,
and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc, let's hear about it, group of, I don't know, twenty-five instead of twelve
Uh-huh.
and each case is presented to that group of twenty-five,
and those cases are, uh, lesser degrees of magnitude. You know,
the guy was caught burgling,
and he had his pockets full of stuff, you know, when he was caught
Right.
you know, that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say, your pleasure your honor,
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing.
Yeah.
But the way our system, our court system works, that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time.
Right.
I just think our system is overworked,
and we're starting to stretch the true meaning of, of right to a speedy trial.
Yeah,
that's, that's a good idea.
Maybe this pre group of people could decide, you know, which kind of, uh, you know, where they could go from there.
Do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury
or do they need a six person jury or, you know, those kinds of things
and the degree of the, of the, you know, the seriousness of it, you know,
how,
is this open and shut, you know, like you were saying,
or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened. You know, a jury like that.
You know, we,
They could be a good idea to,
that could work.
You know, kind of off what we've been talking about here, uh, I believe that our, we've become almost a litigious society where we, everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff,
and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers, maybe we don't need to do that.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know, maybe, instead of being so quick to sue you, uh, if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, maybe you maybe you,
and if you want to, your lawyer or your, your opponent need to go face this group of twenty-five or a judge like they have on T V
Good idea.
Yeah.
and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case.
Yeah,
right
that's,
And let's, you know, let's get rid of some of this harassment suing.
Right,
that's, that's a good idea.
I,
in the BIBLE it says, uh, if you have something against somebody, to go to them first,
and if that doesn't work, then to go get somebody, you know, a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them,
and if that doesn't work, to take it to the whole church.
So that's right off that same kind of principle.
You bet,
and if, If we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the,
That's a, that's a good idea.
Yeah,
that's true,
that's true, too.
But, uh, you know, that whole Biblical concept like that, like that's true in a lot of our,
um, you know, the, the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that.
It doesn't work on that,
but it's based out of that.
And, uh, so that, you know, that could work,
Yes,
I'd forgotten what that's called.
There's a, a real name for that like the Judean law, or something like that.
Um, what is that called?
The Judeo-Christian ethic.
Judeo-Christian ethic.
Well, that may be right.
It's in there some place.
Yeah.
I think we both know that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society.
Right.
Right,
right.
Uh, and, too, the,
that was sort of the beginning of, Ye shall be treated fairly.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I guess the Lord started out with, we'll treat you I'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what I say.
Uh, that's sort of the Old Testament version.
Yeah,
that's, that's,
I know,
I did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where, where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament.
Really.
But that's a whole different subject.
Really,
really,
yeah.
Okay,
well, I, I think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on, on the legal system.
Mine, too.
Yeah,
mine, too.
But it's been a pleasure talking with you.
Yeah,
same here.
What, what part of the country are you from?
I'm living here in Texas.
Oh, okay,
in, in Texas.
Okay,
I was just being curious.
Okay.
Well, that's quite all right.
Yeah,
well, I'm from the Dallas area.
Well, so am I
Oh, okay,
well, that's, that's neat.
In fact, I'm at work out at Lewisville.
Oh, are you really?
Wow.
Okay,
well, I'll let you go.
And it was nice talking to you.
My pleasure.
Have a good day.
You too.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Well, I, I don't think that it's, it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions.
For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives.
Uh, I agree with that.
People that are, uh, driving like, uh, truck drivers and things like that.
Uh-huh.
I definitely think they should be tested.
And I'm not, I'm not opposed to any testing.
I mean because I know I certainly wouldn't want to, to, uh, you know, be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because he was on drugs while he was there.
Yeah.
Uh ...
Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?
Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company.
I think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states
and, because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this
Uh-huh.
and I, I feel like it's really just within the United States.
It's, uh, it's okay.
I think your record should stand for itself. That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.
Uh-huh.
And once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. I think they could, uh, save money by not doing that. You know, every time,
say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.
Well, what about random testing, though.
Oh.
Do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?
Uh, not if it's done fairly.
And that's probably my question is, how, how do you know it's done fairly.
I don't know that you do.
If it's random, then it's random
Yeah.
and that's not necessarily fair.
Well, they might tell you it's random.
Uh-huh.
But then, you know, it's kind of like a, a lottery.
Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries. You know.
Yeah.
Well, I I know that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test
and it's not random.
Oh, I see.
How'd, how did they, how do they pick their people?
Uh, well, I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
Uh-huh.
and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have something to do with it,
but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.
Oh, I see.
So, do you ...
And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.
Right.
Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place. You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs,
do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.
Well, not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally
Right.
but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights.
If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
Right.
and their manager assumes they have a drug problem
I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
it, it would almost be like a, a, uh ...
It's an accusation,
and, and it's and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.
Uh-huh.
And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and, you know, your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.
Right,
exactly.
I, I don't,
the, I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.
Right.
I agree with that.
Because I know personally myself, I've been in the same job for three years,
it will be three years in August
and I've already been drug tested three times.
What type of job do you have?
Well, I'm an environmental engineer
Uh-huh.
and I've been drug tested three times
and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
and the company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus.
So see I, for some reason, I've come up three times.
That's pretty high statistics.
Well, does your does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone?
No.
No,
not at all.
Well, that doesn't,
I mean I ...
It's a legal job, you know
Uh-huh.
so, see it's really strange.
That is odd.
I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, uh,
but I know that they sent, that the job I had before, that, well,
the job I have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company
Oh, uh-huh.
so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.
Right.
Well, does your, the company say, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her
and she came up negative.
Well, no,
I don't think they can, they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I, I didn't, I mean,
Yeah.
they don't know that I don't use drugs.
They just tested me once.
Right,
right.
But, I used to work for a power company,
so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen uh, were clean.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly.
But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh, just across the board.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And are they tested random?
No,
they're,
all of them are tested once every three
They're ...
it's a rotation.
Oh, okay.
I see.
But it,
but again, it depends on what job you're in.
Yeah.
The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
and the men that drive the trucks with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what, what the drug testing schedule is.
Oh, I see.
They say we, we're testing you tomorrow
and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.
Uh-huh.
Okay,
so they know that.
And that's ...
Yeah,
it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Well ...
Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?
Yeah
Okay.
I think so.
Yeah,
seven twenty-five.
Okay.
Okay,
nice speaking to you.
Nice talking to you.
Bye-bye
Bye.
Okay,
so what kind of car are you thinking about getting?
Well, none at the moment
Well, when you decide to.
No,
no,
no.
I currently drive a, a Ford Taurus.
Uh-huh.
And I would I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car, a new car, I will go with the Taurus or something similar, uh, in that regard.
So you like the Ford?
Absolutely.
I have had it for about two years now
Uh-huh.
and it's uh, it's everything it's supposed to be.
Uh, I haven't had a minute's trouble with it
Uh-huh.
and, uh, the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus,
but I still feel a little, even after two years, I still feel uncomfortable driving it, because I had a Honda before that
Uh-huh.
and so it's a little bit larger.
Right.
But that's the only, the only difference that I see, really.
But I would,
my, my criteria would be, at the moment it would be, uh, American, uh, personally,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it's the,
this,
the car I had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I loved it,
I really did.
But, uh, um, I finally decided to go check out what the, uh, what the, uh, foreign cars were.
So I bought myself a, a, a Nissan a two forty S X.
Uh-huh.
But even though I love the car I've got now, I think my next car will probably be American again because if I can at all do it, I'd like to stay American,
Uh-huh.
I always have, up until now.
I just for one time decided to go outside.
So.
Well, my wife drives a, still has a, a Honda Accord,
Uh-huh.
and it's a very, it's an excellent automobile. And, uh, but, you know, price and so forth,
Uh-huh.
I'm not a real car fan.
So, I, I, I do not, uh, opt for, uh, something that would be, you know, expensive you know,
Right.
I want, I want something that's serviceable, serviceable, something that I can use
Uh-huh.
and, uh, and I,
and with the Taurus,
I have a Taurus, uh, L X,
and it's, you know,
you're talking when you think about price, it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines.
Uh-huh.
And as I said, as far I'm concerned, it, it has been extremely, uh, uh, serviceable and everything I wanted.
Well, Ford's done a real good job in the last, uh, say, ten years or at least the last five to six years, so, of really turning around their, um, quality, I think, um.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I think so too.
Now, I, you know,
in travel and renting automobiles uh, in,
Uh-huh.
I've driven, you know, Chevrolet automobiles and so and Dodge,
and I,
if it's Chevrolet, I just will not touch it.
Um.
Uh, I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus.
I purchased a, a Chevy, um, Citation.
Oh, yeah,
those were not good cars.
And, uh, I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it,
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so I, I shopped around,
and I would, I probably, if I had thought I, uh, wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an Accord or even a, a Civic, or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota,
Uh-huh.
Right.
and, uh, but it was just,
I had, I have a friend who, uh, has a, uh, an auto shop,
and he purchased one of the first Sables that was, uh, manufactured for his wife, a Sable station wagon,
and he just absolutely swore by it.
Uh-huh.
And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for, you know, comparable, comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio, and all these other things
Uh-huh.
uh, it was just,
there was no, there was no comparison. Uh,
the only thing that I find, you know, if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride.
Right.
Uh, not, uh,
that's about the only thing I find, you know, disadvantageous to it.
But, my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something that's serviceable,
and I, you know, I drive around a lot,
but, uh, and it's, you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.
I can drive for, you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.
Uh-huh.
But those are my criteria,
and I, I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again,
and if there's something out there that, uh, is comparable to what I have now, I'll go ahead and get it.
Uh-huh.
You know, the only thing I'm looking, at right now, um,
I just, I just bought, you know, the Nissan that I've got about, uh, say, nine months ago,
I guess it was
So the only thing that, that would get me to change cars right now would be if,
see, at the moment I'm single,
and if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it.
But, uh, I don't have any plans for probably another two, three years of even looking, you know.
Uh-huh.
Uh, cars are too expensive right now to, uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years, you know
I,
yeah.
it's
In our parking lots, uh, two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I, I can't remember what the name is.
It's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one, whatever it is,
and it looked, it resembled a Mazaratti of very, very closely.
Um.
And it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth,
Uh-huh.
but to pay that much money for an automobile, uh, is just,
I can't, I can't conceive of doing that
Yeah,
that's, uh,
I went to a, a car show down here about, uh, about two weeks ago,
and, um, you know, of course they had the normal, the Ford, the, the Chevrolet, that stuff.
But then you started looking at the, uh, uh,
they had Ferrari there, they had, uh, B M W and all these other kinds of cars.
And Ferrari didn't even let you near the car,
I mean, they were,
that's how expensive they were.
Uh-huh.
And then you saw, uh, hundred thousand dollar cars,
you saw eighty thousand dollar cars,
and even, even though I, I, I do enjoy cars, I enjoy, um, driving them, I enjoy, uh, riding in them and everything, but, I can't see buying, or paying more for a car than I would for a house, you know.
That's true. Well,
That doesn't seem likely.
The difference there is, too, uh, is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving.
Uh-huh.
I never have been, since, you know, my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen.
Uh-huh.
So I've never really cared.
Now, what I was, you know,
before I was married and before I went to graduate school, I used to do little sports car racing.
I never, it was never my own car
Uh-huh.
it was always someone else's.
And that sort of thing I enjoy,
but to go out and drive, uh, never has really been, had any appeal to me in that regard.
Uh-huh.
So Well I guess we've discussed that enough
don't you think.
I think so.
We won't, we don't, we won't get the recorder or the, uh, system to shut us off, uh, tonight.
That's happened to me almost every time I've,
That's happened to me once,
So, uh,
Well, it's very easy when you get a you get on a topic that, you know, you enjoy.
Yeah,
like, uh, I think the one time I did it was on the Mid, the Mid East, the crisis out there.
Oh, yeah.
That was, had a great conversation,
but, uh, then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more.
So.
Well I was talking to a lady last evening,
and we were talking about fishing,
and, uh, we were cut off, well,
we were told to quit.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, you have a pleasant evening.
You too.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Okay.
So, uh, what do you think about it?
Well, um, I guess I, I'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the, um, the concern for the private, uh, the idea of, preserving privacy for, the individual, um,
Privacy.
Right.
because I can't really see why anyone, um, who has nothing to hide would object.
Well, there is always the, uh, the possibility, even remote as it is, of, uh, of mistaken, uh, of,
That's, of course, that is certainly true,
Yeah.
yeah.
And see that bothers me.
I'm, I'm a, I mean, I'm, I'm very much for drug testing,
Uh-huh.
uh, I really am.
I mean, I'm going, I'm going to take the negative side just for a second, just to do it.
Sure.
Um, see, I have to take, uh, medication for a, uh, for, for kidney transplant.
Uh-huh.
And I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life.
Now, you,
Sure.
I don't know how that's going to affect, uh,
If you had to have a drug test?
Right.
Yeah.
I mean I haven't had one yet.
Um, T I,
I work for Texas Instruments
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and, and, uh, we, you know, we do have the random drug testing
but I've missed it so far.
But I mean, it, in the back of my mind, it always bothers me.
And what happens if it, you know, if it, if they catch it,
they think that I'm, you know, I'm on drugs
and they send me and, and have me, uh, you know, go through this, this, thing, you know,
Checked out or whatever.
yeah.
But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that. Um,
I agree that, that some innocent person might be victimized, by a false test,
Uh-huh.
but I would think that, um, that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that.
For example, that one, uh, positive would not be, uh, accepted as an automatic, um, reason for whatever they might be going, to do if they found a positive, uh, dismissal or treatment or whatever, but that, that what it would do is it would trigger, perhaps, uh, one or two more stages where further tests could be uh, done.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Because, um, there are, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that could come up with, with, uh, false positives for certain kind of drugs.
On the other hand, um, I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for uh, you know, specifically.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.
But, um, in many, many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going to effect anybody but his, uh, you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, um, depending on the kind of drug he might be on.
Right.
But, um, and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works, and so on.
Uh-huh.
But there's so many things that it would make a difference.
I guess I, I, uh, I would not want to have anyone in my family, uh, victimized by someone who, you know, a, a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that, who, um, you know, hadn't been tested.
Right.
Well, I, you know, I'm, like I said, I'm, I'm very much pro testing, um,
and, and this is why.
Yeah.
Uh, number one is I, I'm, I'm kind of,
I know this sounds like a slogan for the government,
but I, you know, we are in a war against, drugs.
Yeah.
I mean it's, it's horrible.
Sure.
I mean, you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and it takes some drastic steps at this point.
And I think, personally, the drastic step has to be that, um, that you can't work if you continue taking drugs.
Yeah.
I mean, it's as simple as that.
I mean, make it so, Well, make it, uh, not necessarily difficult,
Make it difficult enough.
but make it so that it's not glamorous.
Yeah,
yeah.
I mean, it's glamorous taking drugs,
or at least it seems that way.
Yeah,
according to what you, you hear.
Yeah.
The people who, um, have serious problems, I mean,
we have, um,
really I guess we're kind of lucky.
We really only know of one, uh, young man who, uh, who's a
they go to our church,
Uh-huh.
and it's the son and so on,
and he was friends with my children um,
and he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up, um, having been involved with drugs.
But I know of a number of other people who have, you know, gotten all messed up.
Uh-huh.
Most of these are young people.
I work in the education system
and so I have a little more contact with that.
But, um, the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking
Uh-huh.
and he may never really be a productive member of society.
But sadder than that, he may never be able to have a normal, happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are, are almost uncontrollable.
I mean, he, he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that, you know, he, he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not.
Huh.
I mean, he's, you know, he's so messed up.
Right.
And, um, this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, you know,
and he's now a young man about twenty, I guess, who, um, just got really down the wrong path.
Right.
And, uh, you know, I don't know that, that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing.
But seeing what drugs did to him makes me see, makes me realize what it could do to people, you know, in the work force as well.
Uh-huh.
Um, it's horrible.
Well, then,
let's, let's answer the second half of the question.
What limits ought to be put on it, do you think?
Well, the limits, uh, uh, would, I think, have to do with what I'd alluded to before, that there needs to be a further, um, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, uh, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, uh, have set up for those who genuinely have a problem.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
In other words, there needs to be, um, more than,
Treatment before for dismissal type thing.
yes,
right,
Yeah.
there needs to be more than one test,
and there needs to be some, some measure of, uh, certainty before anything drastic happens.
Uh-huh.
There are lots of things that are involved there, um, such as, perhaps, insurance uh, you know, denial of insurance for someone, um,
Uh-huh.
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this, um, that would, that, you know,
it would be unfair,
and people who are on medication, for example, or, um, even people who might be of the gay community,
and I'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society,
but, um, I think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination
Right.
because it makes a bigger problem. Um,
so it seems to me that, that, um, there needs to be some ground, you know, some rules that protect.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure, though, when we talk about what rules, if any, that we should say, well, certain segments should not have to be tested.
I really don't see why,
Personally, I think that's what I was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested.
And, yeah.
Yeah.
I don't, I don't know why it would be, you know, uh, bad to test just
It, you know,
and it may be, you know,
it's not feasible to do everyone,
but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,
That it could happen.
Yeah,
Uh-huh.
would be some measure of protection.
But the bottom line is that, that if, if you're going to stay clean and straight, then, um, you're, you're going to do that because you want to.
Right.
Really.
Well, there's, yeah, there, there's going to be some measure of incentive, uh, reward or whatever,
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want.
Yeah.
So I, I've got to agree with that.
So, um,
That's very true.
Um.
Well, it sounds like we agree, anyway.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think we, I think we did pretty good.
Yeah.
Well, all right,
well, uh, I guess that's about it.
I guess if that's all we've done
and I guess we've talked long enough.
All right.
It was nice talking to you.
It was, it was talk, nice talking to you, too.
Okay,
bye-bye.
All right,
bye-bye.
Well, do you own a P C?
No,
I don't,
I have one at, uh,
the company I work for furnishes,
so I can work at home.
Oh, wow.
And it's just an old, old compact, that is super slow
and, but it does, it does its job,
so.
What processor does it have in it?
Um, I don't know,
it's so old.
It's one of,
Oh what kind of work do you do on it?
Um, I do, um, television ratings
and I process some ratings and put, do graphics for their television stations, their clients,
Oh, okay.
so.
Yeah.
It's basically just data entry and running, you know, some, some software
so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated, you know.
Huh, yeah,
I don't own a P C
but I've, I've, yeah, I work for T I
and, uh,
Yeah,
my husband does, too,
so.
Well, I have, uh, pretty, a fairly fancy one,
it's a T I model.
It's an S P one thousand which, has a, it has a fast processor in it, a three eighty-six.
Uh-huh.
And I,
the, the job that I do,
I do a lot of training of our customers for new products.
Uh-huh.
And I have to develop, uh, functional specs and disk and desk top publishing and everything,
so it's, it's kind of fun,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I mean, I, I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house
but I just haven't got around to doing it yet.
Oh, yeah,
I'd like to have one for the house, too,
but sometimes my husband, my husband says usually, I work on the computer all day at work,
I don't want to come home and have to work on one, too .
Your husband, what, what group is your husband in?
Um, something with the defense.
Oh, ?
Huh?
Defense systems and electronics group?
Yeah,
something like that,
yeah,
they've changed their name so many times I've lost track,
so.
I see.
Yeah.
He works up in Plano.
Oh, okay.
So
Yeah,
I work on, uh, printers and, the peripheral products division, basically, uh,
Uh-huh.
I work in the airline, marketing group.
Oh.
So, we, we do a lot of,
I didn't even know they had anything like that.
Oh, yeah.
Man,
there's so,
they're,
I learned so many things that they, they do,
they're into so many different things,
so.
Yeah,
I just kind of,
in for a while, you know,
he had a, he had, uh, one of those, what are they, top secret things, you know, where he couldn't talk about what he did, so. For a while
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
but then he switched jobs.
I don't understand half the stuff he does
and, I have, uh,
Is he a programmer?
Uh-huh.
I see.
Software design engineer, so, as they call it,
so.
But I have a degree in information management, which is computer, you know,
Uh-huh.
Right.
it's basically the, more the business end of it than the programming end of it, you know.
Right.
So, but I've been at it for, you know, five years,
so. Everything's changed so much I probably couldn't even get a job right now.
It seems like it's changed so much,
so, you know, they've made such advances in computers,
so.
Really.
So, uh, does your husband ever use, uh, a laptop or a notebook?
Does he bring a little one home with him
or,
No,
huh-uh,
sometimes he he brought home a, uh, a portable one,
Uh-huh.
but, uh, it, it quit working
so he brought it, brought it back
and he just hasn't brought another one home.
But they did give him a new computer at work,
so.
Oh, I see.
Yeah,
we, we build, uh, laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also.
Oh, uh-huh.
And those are really handy,
I mean, we, they, they have modems in them, you can send a fax from your P C,
Oh, how nice,
but they're, they're really,
no,
he doesn't have one of those,
so.
What's that?
He doesn't have one of those.
Yeah,
they're, they're pretty handy because, you know, when I travel, it's easy to check messages,
just, you know, plug in the phone to your computer and dial in
Uh-huh.
and,
Yeah.
Well, my husband doesn't have to travel,
so.
Oh, okay.
Yeah,
I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again.
Oh, boy.
Well at least you get to,
So that kind of reeks havoc with plans,
but, it, it's really not enough to become a big hassle.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's good.
Some people enjoy the travel
but I don't think I'd like it, if he traveled a lot .
I see.
Yeah,
I would love to have a computer,
they,
but they're so expensive.
Well, I don't know,
there, you can get, well,
depends on what you consider expensive,
I mean,
Uh-huh.
you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars, where, you know, just a few years ago it would have been six, seven, eight, nine thousand dollars.
Yeah. You know,
I guess it's not, it's all, you know, it's, inexpensive compared to what it used to be
but it's a lot to put into one.
Yeah,
it's still, I mean,
you know, two thousand dollars isn't just, just pocket change to a lot of people
That's right
No,
it's not.
It's, it's not pocket change,
so it's major .
Maybe when the kids get in school that will be, you know,
when they start needing something, you know, then that will be different
but,
Yeah,
when I started at, uh, T I, I was a Summer development student, and finishing up at school
Uh-huh.
and so those papers really,
I mean, it was nice having access to the, equipment to, uh,
Oh, yeah.
Yes,
I remember that.
I had to do some of my husband's papers because I had access to one
but, you know, he, his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing, you know,
so,
Yeah.
I did a lot of his papers.
Yeah,
they come in real handy,
that was a lifesaver.
Well, how many different types of packages do you use?
At home?
Uh-huh.
Um, all I,
the packages I, I don't really use,
I what I use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that I use.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Golly,
I've got,
up, up at work anyway, I use WordPerfect and Lotus and, and which is, uh, uh, a, a line-draw package.
Yeah,
I know those two.
Uh-huh,
I've just used WordPerfect and Lotus and, the most.
Yeah.
You probably use or something like that, for your, uh, data entry stuff that your, talking about.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of the data entry stuff they used, uh, survey system and, and, um, you know, just in-house programs to do what they needed.
I work,
Do you get, do you work at home all the time
or just,
Well, no,
I worked for this company before I had my first daughter,
Uh-huh.
and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things,
so.
Oh, that, that was, that worked out pretty good then.
Yeah,
it did.
You know, I don't do, I don't really don't do basic, a lot of what I used to do,
I just do, you know, something really minor
but, it's something that nobody else wants to do,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and it's time consuming.
So,
So, it keeps you in the company, huh?
That's right, you know,
it gives me a paycheck, you know,
it's only like the work's only, you know, three weeks.
Goes for like three to four weeks three times a year,
Uh-huh.
you know, it's not something that's continual because, you know, the television ratings don't come out, you know, all the time.
They only come out four times a year,
so but.
Yeah.
Boy
I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here, I'd get all kinds of stuff done.
Oh.
Phone's always ringing
and, people always asking me to do something else.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I've got a lot of,
especially right now, we've got several new products coming out,
and I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise.
Uh-huh,
will they let you take a computer home to work?
Well, yeah,
but, you know, I need to be at the office, too.
Oh, uh-huh.
You know I've just got to deal, with all those other things that happen
but, a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I bet.
Yeah,
my he took one home when they, when they had it, you know, they had a big deadline coming up
and it was looking a little touchy to meet,
so.
Uh-huh,
well, I've, I've done that before on, a couple times.
Yeah.
But that would make it just that much easier
instead of bringing home a computer, you just bring home a few floppy disks, you know.
Uh-huh,
that's right.
I thought that would be, you know,
because it's real nice with this because I don't even have to go into the office
I've maybe been into the office once in the past three years, you know.
Oh, my.
They just, um, they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever,
so, you know.
Man that sounds really nice.
Yeah.
It is real nice, you know,
I just deal with them on the telephone,
half the people don't even know who they're talking to.
Uh-huh.
But I, you know, worked,
I know most of them, well,
I can't say that,
a lot of people changed around there
but, most people know who I am,
but I don't know who they are, you know.
Uh-huh.
A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice.
Right.
Yeah,
I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well.
Yeah,
you just know them by the telephone,
so. But, well, it's been good talking to you,
I think we've got the subject
Yeah,
we sort of stayed to the topic anyway.
Yeah,
we tried.
It's hard to sometimes.
Okay,
well, we'll talk to you later.
Okay, well, thanks,
bye, bye.
Bye.
Perhaps this connection,
no,
it still echoes.
Okay, um,
Do you like to cook?
I love it.
I do too.
Uh,
It, it's kind of hard to find time sometimes
but,
Do you work?
Yes.
And have a family?
Uh, I don't have a family,
but I, I usually work about fifty hours a week
and, by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal.
Oh!
I expect so.
Uh, well for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine.
That's, that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party, mine is, is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce,
Oh
so Where did you get your recipe for it?
Um, I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have.
Oh, okay.
Well mine actually came from the, um, Texas Instruments Cafeteria.
Oh.
They, they,
They have a T I plant in Texas, in Kingsport?
Yeah,
we have,
it's in Johnson City.
Oh, uh-huh.
And, um, the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes, you know, like once a month,
they'll put out a recipe of the month.
Uh-huh,
great.
And they, they put this one out
and I tried it
and it was really good.
What is, uh, is a marsala wine a sweeter wine?
Yeah,
a little bit sweeter.
Uh-huh.
And it, uh, it's a, it's a red wine.
Okay.
And, uh, I'm trying to think what else.
I, I roll it in bread crumbs and, uh, Parmesan cheese,
Uh-huh.
and, then I rub it with a little bit, I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil, and pour the wine sauce over it as, like the last twenty minutes, so that it gets just enough flavor.
Huh.
Oh.
Oh, so it kind of browns
and then you put wine over it.
Right.
Uh-huh.
That sounds real good.
And, it's really easy too
so,
Yeah.
What do you use ?
What do you serve with it?
Huh?
What do you serve with it?
I like to serve, um, a wild rice with it.
Uh-huh.
That's what I do too
This is really neat.
And, I,
we're big broccoli fans.
Uh-huh
that's what I've got.
I've got steamed broccoli down on mine
Well, I just, I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that.
No,
it's great.
I've got a good dessert recipe.
Oh, what?
Uh, do you like angel food cake?
Yes.
I just break it up in a glass bowl,
Uh-huh.
and then I mix up, uh, some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta and some cool whip,
Wow.
and I make a thickened blueberry sauce
and I layer it with, uh, angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping.
What time should we be there?
That sounds wonderful
It is, it's great.
I love desserts,
but since there's only two of us, it's really,
Uh-huh.
I, I try to avoid making anything that, too fancy, that, we'd like too much and eat too much
Right.
I know, I know what you mean.
We don't eat desserts much any more.
But I, I guess one that, that I really like, that I haven't made in awhile,
and it's, it's called a fruit pizza.
Uh-huh.
And you take a, uh, sugar cookie, uh, recipe, and, and spread it out on a pizza pan.
Uh-huh.
So you make it like a pizza crust,
and then you, you bake that
and then you, um, take things like kiwi, and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want
Uh-huh.
and you mix that with, um, excuse me, you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice
and I can't remember what else is in it
and you make kind of a glaze,
Uh-huh.
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that.
Oh, and pour that over it?
Yeah.
That sounds great.
It is really good,
and it, it's real light
It would be pretty.
and it,
depending on the fruit you use it's, you know, it's real colorful.
Right.
Yeah.
Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries.
Right.
That would be pretty.
So, but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream
We've been fixing something lately that, well
we've been cooking a lot of, turkey breasts. Because it's low fat.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it's just so much better for you.
And I've been making a hot sandwich.
I toast a piece of whole wheat bread, and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese
Uh-huh.
and then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it, and pop it in the microwave.
Oh!
That sounds great.
It is delicious.
I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody.
No,
and that's that's something that just, you know, it doesn't take a long time to fix,
No.
it's really good,
and it's really good for you.
Yeah,
it's real quick.
And we eat out a lot
and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out,
Right.
and I wish I had something a little bit different, to just like she snaps her zap together.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well
mix up a little, uh, mayonnaise with some dijon mustard, and honey until it just,
Uh-huh.
I mix it until it just tastes good to me.
I was going to say, do you just mix it to taste?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Yeah,
and it's real good.
And it keeps in the refrigerator.
How long, does it keep,
do you, well
you wouldn't have to make,
Oh, it keeps a long time.
Yeah,
and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even.
No,
uh-huh,
it keeps a long time.
I'm sorry I keep coughing.
I've had a bad cold.
Oh.
And I put a little, um, oh, yogurt in it too.
Plain?
Plain yogurt?
If I,
just plain yogurt.
It gives it a little tang.
I'll bet that is really good.
It makes a great sandwich.
Man,
I'm going to have to think of that.
We're getting company tonight,
Oh, are you
and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian.
Oh, yeah,
that's kind of hard.
So, we're going to,
I think we'll try to do something a little bit,
we might try to, to, um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks.
They'll eat fish?
Yeah.
She'll eat fish.
And, I usually,
when they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce
Uh-huh.
and, um, definitely go with, it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, to make up for the lack of meat.
Right,
uh-huh,
that sounds good.
Right.
I had a recipe from that, um, INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO, that's a great salad in summertime.
Do you, do you garden or not?
No
we don't,
our next door neighbors do
and some, a lot of times they'll give us something.
Okay.
it's just sliced tomatoes
and I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty. Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips, just over it, and some red onion slices, and just a little bit of, um, basil, and then a little Italian dressing over it.
Yeah.
Oh!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
And everybody loves it
and it's so easy,
and it's delicious.
That's what I was just thinking,
it doesn't sound like it, it would be hard at all.
Huh-uh,
it isn't.
where did you get,
And you can put some cucumber slices on too.
where did you get this cook book?
I got it at the Checkbook Store.
Really!
And, it's got all these beautiful pictures, in there that are inspiring.
It's going to say, uh, edited by Charlotte Turgeon, editor of,
I'm not french, LaRoute, Gastro LaMink
the creative cooking course.
I'll might have to visit the State Book Store.
I'm trying to see who it's published by, Ottenheimer,
I've never heard of it.
I haven't either.
This edition is published by Bonanza Books.
Okay.
It's a big book
but it was not expensive.
Well, the ones that I've been, I've been wanting to get, um,
I guess you've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN, and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I've been, I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken,
and we do eat a lot of pasta.
Yeah
So, we, we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be, to do without red meat.
That's right.
I don't think it would.
You know, we don't have that much of it now.
As long as we have plenty of vegetables, and lots of chicken.
Uh-huh.
I stir fried some the other night though.
Some, uh, beef and broccoli strips,
it was good,
but it didn't have much beef in it
Yeah,
I've got a, I've got a Wok that we don't use near as often as we used to.
Uh-huh.
We used to stir fry a lot, especially, um, a lot of chicken and, and a lot of rice dishes.
Uh-huh,
it just takes the time to cut everything up.
Yeah.
But usually if I'm, if I'm, if I take a day off or on the weekend especially, I try to cook,  real, real food.
Cook.
Uh-huh
And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead.
Right.
So that we can have those to enjoy.
Uh-huh.
So,
One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK, put out by the Junior League of Denver.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues?
Yes.
Cause, we have some,  some local ones.
they are great.
Uh-huh.
And we have a share alike column in the paper, where people, you know, write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
and that's where I get a lot of my recipes.
Yeah.
They are good, usually good aren't they?
Yes.
And I got, I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time.
Oh, is that right,
what was that?
It's, uh, it's a baked bean recipe.
Uh-huh
And, you mix baked beans and Lima beans
and, uh, let's see, I guess,
You buy the canned baked, canned baked beans?
Yeah.
Just mix the canned beans together, and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup, you know,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and, and you just bake it.
And it's just, it's like a, a spicier baked bean dish.
Oh, that sounds
And, you can add hamburger if you want, to give it a little more body.
Uh-huh.
That sounds good.
So, I, I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find, find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it.
Right
So, I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse.
Uh-huh.
Jot them down, huh?
But, it's been,
I guess we're on.
Well, hang on
let me try it again because usually um.
Do you usually get a message?
Yeah.
Um.
Um.
Hang on let me check on it .
I don't know.
Well, let me try it once more
Well, I think we're on, maybe.
Okay.
I guess we'll find out
Yeah.
So, in Maryland are you, uh, are you a Skins fan?
Um, well, not, not really from, you know,
I really wasn't from here
so, uh, the teams I really root for in football are the Niners and the Seahawks, um, you know, mostly because, only the Niners because I used to live out in California, you know, like, I like Seattle because I like Seattle
Yeah.
and besides I like the city.
Oh, okay.
So, you were out there in San Francisco?
Uh, yeah.
San Jose, actually but but close,
Oh, yeah?
Oh,
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's, um, um, other than the, uh, the big catch, uh, with the Forty-niners and the Cowboys back a few year ago I like San Francisco.
Oh, okay.
But, uh, I, I don't know
I, I never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas.
Oh, is that where you are now?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
I'm in Dallas
and, uh, uh, I guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys um, because, uh, you know this is a big football territory down here.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.
And, uh, uh, unfortunately, of course, the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years.
Uh-huh.
That, uh, uh,
I don't know,
everybody's kind of,
they're still behind them
but, uh, it's not like it used to be.
Yeah.
Well, you know, you, you back the winners
and you don't back them when they're not doing well
That's right
But I think, uh, actually, uh, in, in trying to follow, uh, you know the Cowboys over the years I think, uh, uh, they used to have a, um, a philosophy for, well I don't know, probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh, they always went out and tried to draft the, the best, um, athletes. And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But they would go out and try to go for, uh, the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche.
Uh-huh.
And then about five years ago, four or five years ago, uh, they started going after, uh, uh, specific players or positions, you know,
like the press would get down on Landry,
and this is when Schramm was still there.
Uh-huh.
And, um, they'd go after them saying, uh, jeez what you really need is a defensive end.
So they'd go out and try to find a defensive end
and when they, when they drafted somebody and he didn't work out at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so I think it was kind ever interesting.
I think the decline of the, uh, of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with, uh, not drafting people, the best athletes.
Yeah.
It makes sense because, you know, you, you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can, you know, do a bunch of different things.
Yeah,
yeah.
Um.
But,
And I don't, you know,
my, my, my, my main sport is baseball
but, you know, um, I've been enjoying football
but I don't know it as well.
Yeah.
Um, I just, you know, um,
Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they?
Is it, is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the Walker trade
or what was the whole deal on that?
Uh, they still have some, some, uh, some draft picks, uh,  that they got,
They don't,  have anything high do they?
No.
Actually, they picked up some from Minnesota.
I think it was, uh, Minnesota's ,
Oh, that's right,
that's right.
They,
it went the other way.
Yeah.
What was I thinking.
They gave up, they, they traded Herschel, to Minnesota.
They traded Walker,
yeah
Yeah,
okay.
My brain is really working well tonight.
That's okay,
they, um, um,
I've got a friend that, uh, lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, uh, he gets, he sees them out running a lot
and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys
and they're all, uh, they're all thinking that, uh, man, they, they, they really got something going this year,
Uh-huh.
but I, I guess, uh, when you have a whole bunch of, uh, professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes.
You, know, I guess it's the same way with baseball or, or anybody, you know,
Uh-huh.
Spring training until you actually start going out and getting, uh, getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, you know, if you go to,
I, I, you know, I'm sure if you go to any of the twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say, oh, we're going to be Super Bowl Champs
because, I know, I know in baseball, you know, any manager you go to say, well, we're going to be in the World Series, even though, you know, there's not a prayer
Yeah,
really
Yeah,
Uh,
yeah,
really.
this is the way it is.
Well, Kim , I mean, didn't the Cowboys even finish,
they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they?
Yeah,
they did. As a matter of fact, uh,
Because they only won one game the year before, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
I enjoyed that because it was against the Skins.
Well, you don't, uh, you don't like the Skins?
Um, no.
I, I, I live near Baltimore
and, um, um, I, I really don't like D C a whole lot at all
Oh, okay.
And, um, I mean, I'm really,
they're, they, they got a big thing because of the, you know, the, the expansion going on in baseball.
D C is like talking about how, how they're going to get a baseball team and everything.
It's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team, I'm sorry it's not going to happen.
Jeez.
But, of course, you know, the, the, the one, the griping is that if, you know, if, if Washington doesn't get a, uh, a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team. Which is probably true,
but anyway, um, I just, I've never liked D C a whole lot
and a really hate the Redskins. And a lot of it's because, you know, I got a lot of people, you know, at work with and everything that are big Redskin fans.
Well, of course,
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, um,
of course, then you're not that far from Philadelphia.
Yeah,
I've, I've never liked Philadelphia, the city a whole lot.
The only reason I really enjoy the Eagles at all is because, uh, I really like Randall Cunningham.
Oh, okay.
I,
it was Buddy Ryan, the one that I can't, uh, uh, stand too much.
well, considering how, how well he gets along with, uh, Jimmy Johnson that doesn't surprise me.
Yeah,
really. Oh.
Yeah,
there was, um, uh, there was this, uh, in,
the Baltimore Sun has this, uh, cartoonist in the sports section
and, uh, when, uh,
last,
I guess it was January, when, um, Jimmy Johnson got named coach of the year or whatever.
Uh-huh.
It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired.
And, uh, he had this cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day, you know,
the first thing is the phone call from the, you know, from the league saying he was, uh, um, you know, uh, was coach of the year
and the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan, I got fired can you believe that
Uh, oh, jeez.
Yeah, uh,
actually, uh, you said you lived near, uh, Baltimore?
Yeah.
You're out, uh,
I used to travel out that way a lot
and, uh, actually I used to drive a lot between Baltimore and Washington
and,
No.
I lived,
do you know what Ellicott City is?
Um, no.
Oh, okay.
but well, Route Seventy and, and uh, Route Forty.
Yeah.
I used to go out of B W I a lot.
Yeah,
that's not far from where the, uh, the new football stadium would be if we got an N F L team
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, they've, they've built a new stadium downtown, um,
it's opening next year.
So,
Is that near, near the, what do they,
I forgot the name of it.
Is it the, the Wharf or the, the, uh Inner Harbor.
The Inner Harbor.
Yeah.
It's, um, a couple of blocks west.
There's a big, um, there is an old railroad yard, basically, um,
Yeah.
there's a big long railroad shed
and then there's, uh, an old station
and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the Inner Harbor, which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the Inner Harbor
and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall um,
Great.
but, you know, they're building the baseball stadium
and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a N F L team.
Um. Yeah.
So it's, um, real easy access from, from south of Baltimore like, um, like the airport or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington D C.
The Orioles say they get twenty-five percent of their population, I mean, uh, their attendance from D C.
I tell you what I,
the,
there's,
the Colts still, you know, still to me are the Baltimore Colts.
Uh-huh.
You know?
Yeah.
They really ought to change the name I think in Indianapolis.
I, uh, never been real thrilled with, well, not, you know,
sitting here and talking about all the cities that I hate,
I, uh, I went to Purdue University for a couple of years and, uh, really learned to hate Indianapolis while I was out there
Oh, okay.
And, um, I was not real happy when, uh, when they, uh, left to go, go there of all places
Jeez.
Yeah,
so, uh, uh, you know, did you graduate from Purdue?
No,
I, I, uh, I transferred to Delaware and graduated there.
Delaware?
Yeah.
Oh, there's not a whole lot in Delaware.
Yeah,
but it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore,
Yeah,
so it's,
that's true. coast, right?
Uh, kind of all over the place but, east coast lately,
Okay.
Do you have any children?
No.
I don't.
You don't.
Do you?
Yes,
I have, uh, one. A five year old daughter.
Uh-huh.
Did you ever have her in child care?
Yes,
I do.
She was, um, at a private, well,
I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born.
Uh-huh.
And then I had her at a private sitter for, I guess, two, two and a half years after that.
And how did you choose that sitter?
Um, she was referred to me by a couple of people
and she turned out to be wonderful.
I couldn't have asked for anything better, I don't think.
Yeah.
I didn't want to send her straight to a day care.
Right.
And, even though she was that old, I still didn't want her to go to a day care.
Yeah.
And this lady, you would think it was her own.
Really?
Yeah.
She's real good.
It's hard to find people like that.
Yes.
It is.
And, um, now I have got her in a Montessori school.
Uh-huh.
And she's really, really doing good and learning a lot.
And, actually, I've started working up there in the afternoons, too.
So,
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's neat.
well, yeah.
I guess. I'm going to quit as soon as school, the school season's over.
But, uh, I really enjoyed being with her up there.
I hate it for her,
she has to stay that much longer,
Yeah.
but,
Do they have classes for them during the summer, too?
Yeah.
They, they go uh, year-round, uh teach them.
Huh.
Now, in the summer they have like a lot of field trips.
Yeah.
There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one, and stuff like that.
It's a lot more lax.
But, but they still go through all their, uh, curriculum as usual.
What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there?
Um, gosh
I
my husband and I both went.
We kind of give her the third degree
Uh, good
I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah.
Well, we went over to her house,
so we told her, you know,
well, we didn't tell her, we just told here we'd be over that day.
We didn't tell her when.
So, that way I didn't think,  you know, the house would be, you know, cleaned or anything for me specifically.
Yeah.
Right.
And, um, she had a daughter,
and I want to say her daughter was like six or seven, right around first, second grade.
And, um, at the time she kept one other child, um, about a four year old, I believe.
But it was only like a part-time basis.
So, we went over there
and we questioned her about what she fed them and, um, what she did with them during the day and, um, you know, just how she treated them, how, how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and  stuff like that
Yeah.
And, uh, we really seem to be pleased with her.
And, um,
Did you, did you introduce your daughter to her before you made,  your decision?
Yes,
Oh, yes.
And she still loves her to death.
I,  mean, when they see each other, you know, they just love each other to death.
And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter. Either making her clothes or,  buying her things.
Really?
Yeah.
So, we're real, real lucky.
But uh,
so she stayed with her about, roughly two years,
and she, um, she had to go back to work,
they had some other expenses that came up
so she had to go, I guess, get a real job
Yeah.
Get a real job, full time.
Yeah.
So, uh,
So, what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school?
Well, I checked a lot of places out, you know, the Kinder Cares and the,  stuff like that.
And, uh, I live in Garland.
And, there's this Montessori school that's nearby
and, um, it had been recommended by some friends of ours
but, uh, it, it's an older place.
And so, I, uh, checked out all the new places that were near us
and then I checked that place out
and, uh, even though it was older, it was, it was real comfortable and,  I guess, kind of homey.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And they didn't just play all day long. You know,
like, I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went asked: Can I have some Jell-O? Speaker A answered: and interviewed on, or interviewed at, um, they did a lot of play work and stuff.
And then they,
almost all of them had a Montessori section.
Huh.
And I thought, well, gosh, that must be pretty good, you know, if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into,  into,  their school.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they made sure they pointed it out, you know.
But after I looked at this place, and I took Randi with me, uh, I think just about to every place.
One place I think I didn't take her.
Uh-huh.
And, I just kind of let her go, see, see what she felt like doing.
Yeah.
And that place, boy,
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and, it's hard to drag her away
So, I felt more comfortable at,  that place.
That's,  the true test.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she was real comfortable.
And she has really, really done good.
I, I,
it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her.
Yeah.
But, she seems to me to be, you know, pretty quick and smart
and she's already reading and writing and stuff,  like that.
That's good.
And she just turned five last month.
Huh, that,  is good then.
So,
Yeah.
I think so.
I mean, I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time,
but,
No,
especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years,  in school
Exactly.
I wanted,  to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months,  because I know she's going to have to face that
Yeah,
really
And, oh, my God. Here we go,  you know.
That's right.
I just hate that,
but, anyway. So, you don't have any children.
Do you have any nieces or nephews then ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have a nephew.
He's a little brat.
He goes to a really crummy day school.
My sister's not real bright,
so, but he, he's always sick.
I mean, he has always got some kind of, cold or something.
And, I don't know,
I don't think this place is a very good place for him.
It's just kind of convenient
and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else.
Oh, really.
Just easy to get them,  there and
Yeah.
Exactly.
Well, that's a shame.
Yeah.
I don't think she checks things out very well  Which,  really surprises me.
Oh, really?
That's,  scary.
It is scary.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I I was petrified.
I know.
I would be, too
I mean, that's, uh,
I don't know,
that's just it.
And that's why I don't mind paying more.
Yeah.
Um, I don't know.
I just feel
Too many horror stories out there that,  you know.
Yes.
And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is,  because I know what's really going on.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
I think that's an ideal situation.
Because you don't know, uh,
because like at her school, um, as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive
They sit
and they have car callers
and, and some kid goes out and gets the kid
and,  it's time to go
Yeah.
Huh.
Well, at first that always kind of bothered me.
I mean, not bothered me,
but I thought, well, you know, I'd like to see what she's doing, you,  know
Yeah.
But now that I'm there, I mean, it's, it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. You know, when their parents come,
Uh-huh.
and it's hard to get them out,
and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that.
That's right.
And it's late at night,
so, you know, now it doesn't bother me at all
but,
Is that where the,
over there off of, like,
I'm not sure what the street is,
is it off of, near Country Club,
Yeah.
and all,
Sixty-six.
That one that's, set back in the woods?
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I,  I've seen the signs
That's it.
I love the water aerobics.
Do they have a pool
or what is,
Oh, yeah.
They've got a nice one.
Huh.
They have two types of water aerobics.
They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.
I've heard that that's really good for you to do.
It pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself.
Uh-huh.
So it is like double strenuous.
But you're not being double strenuous on your own body.
Because you're pushing it yourself.
Uh-huh.
So you're doing it yourself.
So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?
Huh-uh.
When you're in the water?
Huh-uh.
The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.
I end up having to quit for a while.
But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because,  I really jump a lot.
Oh, wow.
Well, that's funny,
I never would have thought of that.
Well, a lot of people wear those little, uh, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.
So they just  wear them right into the pool.
Like  Are they water shoes?
Is that,
Yeah.
They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber, you know, soles, so that, you know,
Oh, okay,
okay.
Okay,
okay.
no big deal one way or the other.
Huh, that's really funny
But, I never think about it until after you go there for about a week, your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.
So no big deal.
Huh, that's,
But it's fun.
So, how often do find yourself going?
Um, on a, if you're doing it on a regular basis, how often do you go?
I try to make it at least three times a week.
Yeah.
That's really,
For a while I was doing it every day. Just, going, uh, five days a week.
Really?
I wish that I could make myself exercise every day.
But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week. Which I don't feel like is enough,
but it's, it's at least something.
You know, it, it,
I just force, I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't enjoy it.
But I know that I have to do it.
I mean it's just, it's, it's not a question of whether I want to, you know.
Well,
But,
When I was working up at, uh, The Summit, here in Plano, I'd leave there,
Uh-huh.
and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock. Oh, actually about four thirty because they start at five to six,
Oh, that's,
so I was there by four thirty, every night.
And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.
Uh-huh.
Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.
Uh-huh.
But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, oh, chest, I'd say.
Yeah.
So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,
but,  I enjoyed it higher.
Did you ever,
Well, I'm sorry
That's okay.
Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?
Did you  ever try that?
I have a,  I have a bad back,
so I'm very limited what I do.
Oh, okay.
It's like I can walk,
but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me.
Um.
Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard,
it will bother me.
Then that would,
yeah.
it will bother me.
I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?
Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.
I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles.
Oh.
And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.
She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor.
She says in fact you get more.
Wow.
I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.
Uh-huh.
I like water.
I'm not scared of it.
But I couldn't,
I guess I could swim across the pool,
but I'm no swimmer per se.
Yeah.
But I found that this worked really well.
And I came out of there
and I saw my stomach going down well.
Oh.
I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds. Just by watching what I ate.
Wow.
And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.
What if you're already on one?
I mean,
What?
A diet?
Yeah.
I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?
Oh, no,
they have nothing to do with that.
Okay.
See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.
And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.
And they go over all your health and all your history,
and they show you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.
So it became part of the package,
so I went through it.
It worked out well.
But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program.
Is that what you're saying?
Oh, yeah.
You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.
I see,
okay.
I just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,
so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there, after all this time.
Um.
So it's like when I got laid off,
I went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.
Um.
So I get all the same treatment again.
So it's kind of nice.
Wow.
That's,
Like I said, I like it.
I like the heat.
I like the,
I jump out of the swimming pool,
and I go into the hot tub.
Oh
And I love it.
Yeah.
That would be really nice
Because I have I have never,
let me reword that,
I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore.
But that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.
Uh-huh.
That's,
I knew I was pushing too far.
Uh-huh.
But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.
It's no big deal.
So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,
It's fun.
It's fun.
Uh, I've gotten on the bike.
And they've got, uh, the stepping bike, where you step.
Uh-huh.
And I've enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.
That's, you know,
I wanted,  I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike,
But most of the others to me are very dull.
but I got talked into the bike instead.
And I don't know,
I really wanted a stepper.
I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too.
But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.
I mean, I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them.
Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?
Um, I get bored very easily.
Uh, the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.
Like you said, you can sit and do it, and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.
Uh-huh.
With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.
Huh.
So you have a little, you know, little,
you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so, to what your gear is.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I,
it would depend upon which one you want.
I think now that I've had the bicycle,
I would go to the stepper.
But if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.
Because you can buy a month's membership. And see what you feel is best for you.
Oh, really?
Um.
Because it all depends, you know, for everyone their own what they want to do.
Because I jump on the bike here at home.
Mine has its, see, the handle bars go up and down,
Uh-hum.
so I can sit there and read and listen to music, like what you said,
and it has no effect on me.
So I mean, it's boring
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Do you want to go first?
You can go first,
or I will.
Well, you go ahead.
Okay.
Well, I'm going to tell you what I'd have
Down in the south, we have a lot of shrimp,  okay?
Oh,
yeah.
And I have, uh, shrimp that is steamed in beer, that I cook.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook, garlic bread, green salad, tea,
and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.
Oh, it sounds fantastic.
Yes.
And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in your, uh, like your rice steamer,  your rice cooker.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
And, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,
and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.
Uh-huh.
Now, you can either use, you know, the kind that comes in the little can
or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.
Is it cayenne pepper, you mean?
Cayenne?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And you put a little bit of that over it.
Now if you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them.
Yes.
And you put that in there,
and then you pour two bottles of beer over it.
And how much shrimp would you use?
Two pounds.
Two pounds,
okay.
That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.
Oh, yeah.
Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up.
Uh-huh.
And you pour the beer over the top of it,
and you cover it.
Uh-huh.
And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil,  and the shrimp turn pink.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Then you remove it,
and you put it on a platter.
And then you serve it with melted butter.
And, uh, I usually put garlic powder in mine.
Oh, yeah.
And they can just dip it,
and they shell it as they eat it.
Sure.
But, uh, then the uh, the cauliflower, you,  cook that in the microwave.
Uh-huh.
And what you do is, you just, uh, wash it,
and you core it. And in a like a, oh, what do you call it? Like Pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that would go in the microwave.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
A glass dish.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it's got to have one that has a cover on it.
Okay,
uh-huh.
And you, uh, put about two tablespoons of, uh, water into this bowl, and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt.
Yeah.
And then you just set your cauliflower in there,
Uh-huh.
and then you cook it for seven minutes on high.
And you rotate it one time.
And it's, are you cooking the whole head at one time?
Uh-huh. Uh, when you core it, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off.
Okay.
I see.
And, uh, you just set it in there,
and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,
and you turn it one time.
Uh-huh.
And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,
and I mix it all together.
And I shred up some just regular white cheese.
Uh-huh.
And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it,
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that.
And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know,  just mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it.
Uh-huh.
And,  it's done.
Yeah.
Oh, that sounds fantastic.
It is good.
But it, it looks,
I mean, what you can do then, see is, like what I usually do is, I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle,
and then I put the, uh, shrimp around the outside of it,  you know, on my platter.
Um, um.
Uh-huh.
And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that.
And, you know, you have all the different seasonings and stuff,
and then I just fix little individual cups for them.
And they have the,  garlic bread,
Sure.
and it makes it a real nice looking,  you know.
And it's  not much work.
Huh-uh,
huh-uh.
But it looks like it, you know
That sounds,
Yeah,
You look like you went to a whole bunch,
I bet it tastes good too.
Right.
And, uh, usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up,  and put some color into it, you know,
Oh, yeah.
and I'll lay those on top of my salad, you know, to make it look nice and things like that.
Now, how many could you serve?
Okay.
Uh, it usually serves six.
Yeah.
okay.
I figured about that.
Yeah.
Oh, that's good.
See out here, we have so many, uh, ethnic people.
We have Italians,
and we have Portuguese,
and we have Russians and Polish.
And it depends, out here, like the type of people you're going to entertain, you know?
Uh-huh.
So it's hard, uh,
you, you just have to pick something, for the, the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time.
Yeah.
And, uh, they're big on finger food here, too. You know, chicken wings and, uh, ribs, and that kind of stuff. Uh, barbecue and, uh, cooking out in the yard, it, you know, when it's nice. Barbecue outside, chicken and that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have you ever had crawfish?
Uh, no,
but I have had shrimp.
Oh. You ought to try some crawfish.
They are good.
But see, that's one good thing about living down here is, usually anybody that comes over, you know, even if it's like, out of town guests and stuff, they want our cooking.
Oh, of course.
You know,  they want it from down here.
That's,
Yeah.
Because, just like now, especially crawfish, it is starting to move out, you know,
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is.
Really?
But,
Is it like shrimp?
Uh, it's similar.
Uh-huh.
It's similar.
Yeah.
It's not exactly.
I mean, it's got a taste of its own, you know,
but it is,  it is similar to, because you only eat the,  tails of it.
Oh, it does?
Does,  it look like a lobster?
Um, it looks more like a crab.
Oh, it looks more like a crab.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
But,
Are they thin, long or wide?
No.
Um, let me think of, I can't even think of what you,
I guess if, it, uh, it looks like, more like a cross between, uh, a crab and, uh, and a lobster.
Uh-huh.
Because it's small like that
and it's got the pinchers like a crab.
But,  you know, it's, it's similar to a lobster too, because the tail has got the little pleats in it, like a,  lobster would.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.
Yep.
And we call them mud bugs
Oh
But, I mean, they're fantastic tasting.
They are so good.
Everybody,
it's, it's the season for them right now.
And, and where did you say you were from?
Louisiana.
Louisiana.
Oh, well, do you do cajun cooking?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I love, uh, blackened, you know, uh, the, the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff.
Uh-huh.
Oh! We have a few places up here that do that.
Yeah.
And if ever I see it on the menu, I always get it.
Yes.
It is so good
You know,
Now how do they do the blackened?
You buy it, you buy it as a seasoning.
But, uh, do you have to have a certain skillet,  or something?
Huh-uh.
Huh-uh.
No?
I cook mine, well, do you have a, uh, like a black iron skillet?
I did have.
I don't have it now.
But I have mostly Teflon.
Oh, okay.
Well,  I guess you could cook it in, in that too,
You now,
but,
but I don't know.
You know, I never have.
I use, uh, uh, the black iron skillet to cook mine.
does it have to get extremely hot?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But it really, it's not, it, it, it doesn't burn or anything like that.
The blackening is really the seasoning.
Uh-huh.
I mean, there is,  it's, it's,  a blackening seasoning.
Oh, oh,  I see.
Yeah.
You know, I mean, that is a seasoning.
That's really, it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time, or something like that, to get it,
Oh, I see.
Because, it's called, uh, what it's called is, Blackening Magic.
And it, it comes in a bottle,
and, uh, Well, I'm trying to see.
Oh.
It's got a, a picture of Dom De Luise on it.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Now would, you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would, prepare it any other time?
Right.
Is that what you're saying?
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh-huh.
Because,  I could have the, uh, chicken on the skewers, with, uh, uh, blackened seasoning.
But,
Uh-huh.
And, oh, that is so good. Delicious.
Yeah.
But you do have to have it, you know, you do have to have it hot when you cook it. I mean,  your pan.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It does have to be really hot, you know, when you put it in.
But it's not like it's burned,
and it, what it, what blackens it, is the seasoning.
Oh.
And it is so good.
Oh!
It is.
I, I love it.
Yeah.
I, I, in fact I was in Texas for a little while.
Uh-huh.
And I liked, uh, the barbecues and the Mexican food.
Uh-huh.
I have a passion for all that type of different tastes.
Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food.
Because my, uh, parents are Italian and Portuguese.
So we cook a lot of pasta, and, uh, gravies, and pizzas, and, you know, roasts, and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and have, you know, trying different things.
Well, have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana, you know, to visit?
I would love to.
Yeah.
You ought,  to come down.
I,
Um, you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans, you know, if you want to really get some good food.
Really?
I mean, you don't have to go that far south.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, of course, the further south you go, the better the food is, as far as I'm concerned.
Is that right?
And fact is, we're going to take a vacation this year.
We're going to go to New Orleans, again.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, we're only going down there for the food, though
Now, where do you go when you go there? Uh, right on Basin Street and those places?
Uh, yeah.
We go to the, the French Quarters and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I have some friends that live down there.
And so, usually we go to, we don't go to the tourist ones.
Oh.
We go to the ones that they tell us to go to, you know.
Oh, I see.
And we went to this one,
it was called The Back Porch.
And, uh, they were cooking the stuff, you know, while we were, we went on this boat ride.
And then we came back and ate, out on this, it was like a back porch
And, uh,  usually if you can find somebody,
Oh, that's nice.
in Of course now, when you go down there, you know, I mean, they've got just,
there's no where you can miss.
Uh-huh.
I have never gone to a restaurant, and not just been so full,
it's unreal.
Really?
I mean, it's so good.
The seasoning they, it's just unreal.
And don't they make a lot of, um,
I'm trying to think what they call their soup.
I don't know.
Gumbo.
Yeah,
jumbo.
No, gumbo.
Gumbo,
Uh-huh.
right.
Right.
Is, is, is that with seafood?
Uh-huh.
You can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood.
Oh, you can?
Uh-huh.
That looks good too.
I've seen them the chefs on T V do that?
Uh-huh.
And oh, it looks delicious.
And I'll tell you what.
See we do, um, uh, a thing, we call it a sea bake.
You, uh, you take clams,
Okay,
well, you,
Do you have any pets?
Um, we got two cats.
Two cats.
Yeah,
and, uh, um,
yeah,
we had cat, you know, my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies,
Uh-huh.
so, I mean, I'm used, I'm used to having cats around,
I like them.
Yeah,
I like having cats around or pets around in general
I, I favor dogs over cats actually
but,
Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all
Oh, I'm, I'm a dog person.
I had,
I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid, right?
Yeah,
probably,
I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid, in fact,
Uh-huh.
I may still be,
um, we,
But not cats.
That , um,
I wonder sometimes
Uh-huh.
Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago
and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything,
we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything
and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend
and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday,
it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog.
It was like, oh, that could be it.
The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek, of the dogs, and constantly .
Yeah.
Well, dogs are real high maintenances,
you got to take them for walks
and you've got to pay a lot, you know,
you need to pay attention to cats and everything
but it's not quite the same thing.
Yeah,
that's true.
Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know,
all cats are indoor cats,
Uh-huh.
so, you know, they're not, you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood
and, you know, they, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is,
Limited.
yeah,
it's, you know, it's a pain to clean
but, you know, we used to,
I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans .
They didn't,
Oh, really?
Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time,
and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything
it was really terrible.
But now they have like this, you get these liners, that is garbage bags, you know,
Uh-huh.
and you, and you, you know the,
Oh, that sounds so easy, what I did,
Yeah,
the cats do it in there,
you pull it and take it out and throw it away,
and that's it,
Yeah,
I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis,
Uh-huh.
and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter
and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing.
Same idea
Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,
Everyday?
and so it wasn't so bad.
Oh, okay,
I see.
two cats and just as easy
it just never started smelling,
I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there, because if I put a lot, one of the cats would have been,
Uh-huh.
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.
Uh-huh.
I that true,
yeah.
Yeah,
she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats
and her dog there is, is basically a reject,
somebody had bought him, and wanted him.
Uh-huh.
It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was
and now, she's stuck with it.
Uh-huh.
And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat
because that's all there is to it.
So, you know,
So, you don't have anything right now?
No,
we don't have anything right now.
Oh, except the kid,
huh, that's ,
Oh, right,
now we have a kid
but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat,
he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid,
and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend,
And,
Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um,
yeah,
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,
Uh-huh.
and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really,
I mean they're, they're happier when we're around
but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves,
um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.
That's, uh, yeah, really true.
But like the friends, other friends of mine have cats,
they have four of them,
and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that
and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,
Well , that's, That's, um, pampering the, the petals
and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that.
I, I tried to have, um, figured something having,
so I tried to have a goldfish,
Uh-huh.
and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.
But they're not that much fun, you know,
you can't take them for a walk,
you can't, you know,
they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,
Right.
they they can't do anything,
so I've never,
I think we had fish when I was a kid
but I don't,
My brother had fish when I was a kid
I remember that,
and one of his fish jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank. And fried itself, on the radiator behind the dresser.
I'll never forget that
because I remember my brother, he came home and he counted the fish
Oh.
and one of the fish was missing
and they couldn't find it anyplace,
they couldn't figure out what had happened
and then they found it fried on, the radiator behind.
Oh.
it was not gross,
I didn't see it
but, um, got them.
Oh.
Trying to remember we had a dog for a while,
and I don't know if we got rid of the dog
because my brother was allergic to it,
my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now,
Uh-huh.
but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards
and then he had fish.
Uh-huh.
And you,
they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
No,
it's like,
I just, I don't know,
I, I just never understood why, what the attraction,
I mean, they're, you know, they're pretty and everything
but I've just never seen the attraction of having fish.
It's not as much fun.
Well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,
an eel?
and then he had a, um,
I forget what type of fish it was,
it was one of these fish that it would eat, it ate a big other fish and things like that.
There would be sort of moby fish in a tank.
Oh, now we really get sick
Yeah,
and it,
I, I couldn't see having fish like that.
Yeah.
I could see some having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty
but,
Like, I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha, and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in
Uh-huh.
this is not, these aren't cats, you know,
Yeah.
this is gross.
Yeah,
no,
that would be,
what did they do, everyone come around and watch them.
Yep.
I mean, I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house, and your things destroyed the mice.
Yeah,
well,
But,
Yeah,
well, a cat will do the same trick
Let's see ,
I had a pet rat, for a while,
and it was a live rat,
and, um, this woman just offered it to me while I was in, in graduate school
and, she was actually a very fun pet.
I had a friend in I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a while.
Uh-huh.
Um, I forget how she got it,
but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal
I think she got it,
I think she was a psych major
and she got it from the psych department.
Yeah ,
mine had been a, a, a
how did this work,
a mill rat had been bought
and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you know, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick,
and she said, I don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant,
Whoops
And they had misclassed the sex of back there
and so, um, she asked me if I want to, one of those babies,
and I took the baby
and I got her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like, half the price of a mouse,
Uh-huh.
and then she grew to be, you know,
I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand
and then she grew to be pretty big, you know, like a pound or something
Uh-huh.
I don't know how much,
and I had her for over two years
and she was very affectionate.
She would, you know, crawl on me
and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working, and things like that. Yeah, much more than you would think.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah,
I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts,
so .
Yeah
and,
Yeah,
rats are not my favorite animals in the world,
but I could see getting one from birth and everything.
Yeah,
I, sort of weird for me to have had one too
but there,
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage
and, you know, it was easy. Easy to take care of
Yeah.
and but,
Yeah,
I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils
and they, they tell me the same thing.
Uh-huh.
I just,
again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be.
I,
Actually it was more fun than you would think. Yeah, starting from the beginning
but, um,
yeah,
we live, also live in the city now, actually in Manhattan.
Okay.
And so it's almost impossible to,
it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,
Right.
I mean, people do,
Oh people,
but it's not,
I don't, oh,
plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York,
so, you know .
Oh, yeah,
you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them,
it's really kind of funny.
Yeah, uh ,
I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,
Uh-huh.
we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.
Right,
no,
they don't.
I should make you ,
Of course, not.
they have, um, the bags behind them
but I think they're actually supposed to, keep them, yeah, keep them clean
Hit the bags.
but, oh, gosh, I can't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime,
just the smell is so bad of the horses.
Oh, God, I can't, Haven't been up there,
last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad
Oh, well, it's not that long ago.
It was , Oh, twelve times, of the year.
Not this past fall
but I mean fall, a few years,
I mean, it it was in the, yeah, it was almost like October of eighty-five,
Uh-huh.
I think was the last time I was up, up there and at Center Park.
Yeah.
Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia
and I used to go up and visit her.
Uh-huh.
Um, so,
Yeah,
that's not too far from were we live,
do you have, you said you had two cats,
are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything
or are they just,
No,
they're just mutts,
Uh-huh.
yeah,
my wife got them from, uh, um, friend of hers at work and everything, you know, you know, as kittens,
Uh-huh.
and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met.
Um, she's had them for a couple years.
And um, you know, they're really cute,
they're, they're sisters,
Uh-huh.
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one
and, she pushes the other one away from the food.
Apparently I don't know all the details
but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel
and the other one is named Holly.
Uh-huh.
You know, the
They're both females?
both, yeah, both females, they're both spayed, um, or whatever it is, neutered, you know, um,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.
Uh-huh.
Okay,
the topic was, should the United States adopt the metric system, and if so, should, uh.
How should they do it?
Why didn't it work last time?
And why didn't it work last time?
Well, I'm all for it.
Yeah,
well, I, I am too.
I wish, uh, it had started a long time ago, is the problem, because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that, you know, trying to convert over,
Yeah.
and I guess, what'd they try, they tried what'd the call it, soft conversion and hard conversion
Yeah,
they tried the,
one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard
and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.
Yeah,
yeah,
direct conversion.
I, I don't know. Uh.
I think they just ought to, you know, start, uh, just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever, you know, start your packaging, go to liters instead of quarts,
and you know, people if they have to are going to learn to think that way.
Well don't most of them, doesn't just about everything now have both metric and English.
They do,
but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages, you know.
You buy a quart of milk,
and sure it has, has the metric equivalent written on there,
but it still a quart.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
But if they started putting it in liters, liter of oil, and you know, liters of gasoline, people are going to learn to think in metric.
As long as you can still buy a product in the English units, that's how you're going to think of it.
I kind of remember back when gas prices started up, you know, pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range,
somebody had, uh,
I believe it was Exxon
It figures.
we were living in Lubbock at the time,
they started marketing it in liters,
and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter.
So they could put this sign out front that said, you know, thirty-nine cents a liter.
Right.
And nobody had any idea what a liter was,
so, uh.
That, that's the problem.
When we finally out that liters was about a quart, there's about four liters in a gallon
so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it.
Right.
It's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age,
I don't know,
when I was growing up, we were talking metric system in school. I mean, not, not at first,
Uh-huh.
but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway.
Yeah.
Oh.
I would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is, anyway.
A liter's about a quart.
The, uh, I think maybe there's where the problem came in, you know.
We've tried to, instead of learning,
it's kind of like learning a language, you know,
when you learn one from the other, you always end up in this conversion thing all the time.
Yeah.
So, you,
it's almost like, uh,
course this country isn't a dictatorship,
but, you know, it's like somebody said, okay as of such and such a date, you know, anybody caught talking in the English, you know, will be shot or something like that, you know.
But, uh,
Well, thing is, it's a global, global market place these days,
and, you know, we're like, what, one of two backwards countries in the world, as far as,
Yeah,
I read that, what Uganda and,
Something.
I don't remember what the other one is
but,
There's one or two others that just,
It's just time I think for, for us to go over.
Because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international
Uh-huh.
I don't, you know,
I work for T I,
we're all around the world,
you have to perform this conversion anyway.
Yeah, uh, I, Yeah, I do, too.
And.
And one of the things that we've run into a problem,
course you're familiar with the T I drawing, well, with any drawing system you end up with, you end up with things in inches in parts of inches, you know, half, fourth, you know, this sort of thing.
Right.
Mils and microns.
Right.
Right.
And then you end up with a decimal, where you start getting into mils, and that sort of thing.
Right.
And then some of them are done in, you know, purely metric.
Yeah,
I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns
and ours were in mils.
Uh-huh.
And it got to, you know,
somewhere down the line they went standardized,
they went microns,
but, uh, you just, you know, you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs.
Yeah.
Oh, I can imagine.
So.
The, uh, the one that, uh, uh,
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric.
No.
I was with T I in El Salvador for a while,
and I had to get used to, you know, purely metric system down there, because they didn't understand anything else.
You know, if you start talking about miles, they'd look at you like, what.
Yeah.
So, I had a little bit of experience with it,
and also I noticed in Canada they, uh, you drop a quarter, fifty cents, whatever, in a coke machine up there,
and you get this funny looking coke, you know,
it's in a can that's that's taller but not as big around.
Yeah.
You know, I guess that's some
About half a liter.
it's not a liter,
it's like a half a liter or something like that.
It's a strange looking can.
But my daughter in law's from Panama,
and she has, they have had Americans down there for so long, you know, that they're kind of into both systems,
but, uh, she gets real confused on distances
and temperature is the big thing the Centigrade for which she says Celsius.
Yeah.
I would have more problem more problem with the temperature, except that, you know, working in engineering, we do everything in Centigrade, or Celsius.
Well, I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature, you know,
if it's between zero and ten, it's cold,
and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad,
if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,
It's getting warm, right.
if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out.
So, but, uh. The big problem is not having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is.
You know, you don't get all the little differences
Yeah,
it's about.
you know, the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much,
but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is, quite a bit.
Is about twice as much, what it works out to.
Yeah,
five
One point eight times as many points.
Yeah,
something like that.
Yeah,
so. I, I think as long as people have a choice, they're going to stick with the American way.
Uh-huh.
And until we have to, have to learn to think that way, we won't.
Yeah.
Though we call it the English system,
but I'm not sure what they do in England now.
They're, they're on metric, aren't they?
Yeah,
for the most part, I think so.
Yeah,
except they've got a,
now, okay, we run into some problems once,
I remember, they've got a nut and bolts system called Wentworth.
And this thing was, was even different than, you know, S A E standards and stuff.
So,
Right.
This, this,
okay,
my dad bought one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years quite a few years back,
and the thing had a Austin Heeley type engine, you know,
it was Austin motors engine and running gear.
Right.
And the body was built by Nash,
or who, you know,
that was even before American Motors,
but Nash, essentially, in the U S somewhere.
And that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and, uh, S A E.
He ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing.
He just get one more .
Because I think the Wentworth and the S A E bolt sizes were the same,
but the threads were different,
and, uh it was a total mess.
Oh, that would be a mess.
And on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old.
Part of it's built in Canada.
Matter of fact, the thing is, I always say it's built off shore, you know, because it was assembled in Canada.
The only thing that was in it was built in the U S was the, uh, differential,
and it was built in Buffalo, New York.
But it's got the hardest combination of, uh, metric
and, most of the body parts seem to be metric,
and most of the engine parts seem to be S A E,
so. It's just crazy.
Right.
It just gets bad,
now, you got to, you got to have one, and not mix them up.
Yeah.
Because you're never going to get to one, one system if you still got a, got a mix.
And of course, here that, that would involve changing road signs all across the country, you know, miles per hour to kilometers per hour, and the whole nine yards.
Kind of hard to do gradually.
I thought maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit, because what is it fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred, uh, a hundred kilometers,
Yeah.
and you know
Hell, you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour.
yeah,
you'd have,
hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five,
you'd have people going, you're right, a hundred miles an hour.
Yeah.
And, so. I don't know,
I'd kind of,
and the other thing, too, is, you know, between here and El Paso's, what, five hundred miles,
but it's almost eight hundred kilometers, you know.
That'd sure seems like a long way.
Yeah,
but they'd need, they'd seem to be ticking off faster, too.
Yeah,
I guess that's it.
Every road sign you come to, is like, well I don't know it that far.
Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour, you know,
they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.
Yeah,
I think they,
you got the problem with all your cars are still,
yeah,
you still got cars on the road that don't have both.
Yeah.
At that time, anyway, that was still when things were,
the metric system was still not,
Not all that common.
You know, now cars, they have both.
Sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way.
I know the only other place that I was ever at where they really had it mixed was, was in Panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour
and some are in kilometers.
And you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour,
Yeah.
Uh, so, Jack, what type of music do you like?
Well, I like, uh, classical, and, uh, sort of, uh, popular rock type music. Uh,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I enjoy classical too.
I never really had listened to it till I, I got married,
Oh.
and, and my wife, uh, enjoys it.
Uh-huh.
So I had never listened to it till then,
but now I listen to it well, whenever she does.
And even every once in a while I put it on myself, you know.
Yep.
Um,
Yeah,
I, I used to play the piano,
and I like, uh, Bach and, Um, sort of the baroque music, Handel and, uh, Vivaldi and those kinds of,
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah,
see those, those are really nice.
I like those.
Yep,
yep.
Though I, I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says, This is Bach, you know.
Oh.
Yep,
yep.
Well, I, you know, I don't, I don't know all that much myself,
I just, I just know, when I hear it that I like it.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that you
what you like.
How about popular music?
Yeah.
Uh, whatsever's on the radio is, is usually okay with me,
but, um, sometimes I have a hard time you know, hearing the words clearly if I'm in the car and there's noise and stuff
Um. Yeah.
so,
It's mostly just the tunes.
Yeah,
I'm pretty much the same way.
You know, people always say, Wow! the meanings of those words.
Yeah,
I know.
And I'm always, meaning?
There's well, you know,
I just thought they just all sort of rhymed, you know.
I know,
I know.
About the only thing I can remember after the song is over is the refrain.
Right,
yeah.
That, whenever they say it two or three times.
Yeah,
yeah.
I'm the same way
Yeah.
It's funny, uh, depending on where you live,
I, I, I commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury, which is two and a half hours away,
Uh-huh.
and the difference in the radio with popular music, is totally different, you know,
Uh-huh.
when,
Oh, really?
Yeah,
because Baltimore will play more, uh, what might be considered a little bit more progressive?
Uh-huh.
And as soon as you go down to Salisbury, this town that's, you know, uh, two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever, uh, in a real rural uh, Maryland, they, it turns into basically classic rock.
Yes?
Yeah?
And they don't, you know.
Oldies or what?
Yeah,
mostly oldies.
Yeah.
But classic rock, you know, with,
if, you know, like when the Doors movie came out, you know, Doors was really on the radio there, you know. Where, you know, you'd hear one or two of their more famous songs, maybe top forty in Baltimore,
Uh-huh.
but in Salisbury, you that's all you would hear was, This is the Doors!, you know.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
So, it was sort of a funny thing.
Yeah,
yeah.
There's a big variation among the country,
I mean, if you, go down south, country music and,
Yes,
that's,
I'm starting to realize that.
I never really thought about that much,
but there is.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
I never, I never, I didn't,
So,
I, I lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore,
and I didn't, I never really noticed the difference when I moved to this area?
Uh-huh.
I really didn't notice at all.
It just seemed the same.
Yeah.
But when I went more rural, you know, that, it really changed.
Yeah.
So,
Yeah.
Chicago has a lot of good stations, uh,
Oh, does it?
Yeah.
Yes.
Uh, in fact they have, they have a continuous news station, which is nice if you're driving and you want to
Yeah.
now, you don't have to wait till the hour mark.
It's, it's, it's sort of constant.
You just turn there,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, you get the latest news and everything.
It's, uh, it's sort of like C N N, you know,
you turn on your T V
and it's on.
Right.
Yeah.
Boy, that would really be beneficial.
So, yeah.
Because you never hear the, you never hear the news basically on the radio.
I never get it.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know, and if you don't, if you don't read the paper, you sort of fall behind if you're in, the car all the time.
Yep.
Yep,
yep.
Yeah,
that's pretty good.
So,
yeah,
I like to listen to tapes, uh, of music or, or, um, stuff on a long trip.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, um, now you can even get books on tape, um.
Yeah,
yeah.
On fact, my, uh, my grandmother does that a lot, because she's blind,
Uh-huh.
or she's losing her sight or whatever.
Yeah.
But,
yeah,
that, of, in,
I can imagine, you know, if you're driving cross country, you know, uh, listening to a story.
Uh-huh.
lot of the classics are really, on tape.
Right.
Yep,
yep.
Yeah.
So, that's a lot of fun
but,
Yeah,
that's, that would be good.
Yep.
Well, we strayed a lot from music.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Well,
But I, but I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening. So as long you're listening.
Right.
So,
Right.
Yep.
But if you do, if you do have to go something, I guess we can just cut off.
Yep.
Okay.
Well, Jack, it was nice to talk to you.
Yep.
Nice talking to you, Tom.
and good luck,
and I hope you get some more calls and make some more calls.
All right.
Good.
Bye.
Thank you.
Bye, bye.
Well Carol since today's subject is our homes,
why don't you tell me about yours.
Okay,
I live in Plano, in a four bedroom, two bath house, which is the area's dominantly three bedroom, two bath.
So, I'm just a little bit different than typical, uh,
and of course, the Plano area is basically with alleyways,
so everything around here is set up that way. Which I think is a little bit different than most areas, in the houses, the way they're constructed.
And it's a brick house, with, uh, some wood.
It's real nice,
I like it
How about you?
Well I, I certainly hope so.
We have a, a classic ranch, up in Denton.
Ranch style home, I I would hate to think that anybody thought, uh, the lot we live on as a ranch.
Uh, it's in a subdivision and one story.
It started out life as a three bedroom house, and now has no two car garage and has, uh, the two extra rooms enclosed.
I suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms
but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage.
Are most of the houses in your area three bedroom, two bath?
Almost a hundred percent.
I, I can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision.
Ours is probably the closest to it.
You know how realtors are,
they'll say, oh this could be five bedrooms.
Yeah,
if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house,
Yeah,
to .
don't need a closet
The only thing about mine, um, I think there's probably about, oh, when I go down the street I can just pick out houses that are, that are identical to mine
and usually they are the four bedroom, um,
but they're spaced out, oh I'd say maybe three, on a two block period.
Because it's all different builders up here.
So it's kind of hard at that point to, you know, classify some of the builders.
But most of the builders all built three, two.
But the one thing, my house is a little bit different
and I can pick it out again because it's not typical,
is I've got the, oh, what do you call a, uh, double ceiling, double high in one half of the house.
So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings.
Uh, cathedral ceilings.
And, uh, the kitchen is norm
and the bedrooms are norm.
So it just goes down the dining room, the family room, and the living room that way.
And I love the space.
It just, it's, uh,
luckily I came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceiling
and I just lucked out and walked into this one
and of course I felt the same airy feeling, which I liked it real well,
so it's a nice thing to move into,
but, again, it's not typical in this area.
You can just spot them because the the roof is so much higher.
But, uh,
Well I hadn't thought about it in that sense, of the high roofs.
We have cathedral ceilings in, uh, two rooms. In the, uh, family room and in the master bedroom
and those are, are pleasant.
Yeah.
Well it's like when my son goes up into the, up into the furnace area over the garage.
Yeah.
He can walk
and he's six foot.
And he says, oh, come on up mom. I'm not going up there
I'm not going up there,
but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room.
So that means if I knock out the wall in my family room, I could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem.
But, um, I'm not that ambitious.
I
maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and get angry I'll start poking holes up there, but until that time
But, uh, I've noticed the houses around here are basically, it's one story and they're all basically two, uh, bath, two, uh, with three bedrooms.
And we're
ninety, I would say about, oh, about ninety-five percent, no I guess probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, uh, with some wood.
Right.
But it's, it's basically all brick.
The next subdivision over from me is total brick
and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine.
But, uh, the one on opposite the street now, they're total brick
and they're basically almost all three, two.
They're all three, two.
But of course they have a little river going down their area too, which is kind of nice
If it's the kind of river I'm thinking of, better them, than, than us, you know
Are you talking about a, a real river, creek?
No
it's a creek,
they've put little fountains in and such.
Well that's nice.
Uh, I came from Mississippi recently
and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains
and they didn't pay any, any attention to banks and that kind of stuff.
Oh.
So you're just as likely to wake up and discover you're in two inches of water.
Do you have a lot of property, I mean a lot of yard around your house now, in Denton?
Uh, it's a third of an acre.
I don't think that's a lot, uh,
in fact, I have been real disappointed in the six years that I've lived out here about lot sizes
I'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have.
Yeah,
when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all.
They're built practically on top of each other.
That's true.
I know, I was,
An, and while, while there are some advantages to that, there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things.
Uh, I just feel hemmed in by that.
It's not as comfortable a living for me.
Uh-huh.
Well this subdivision here has got,
oh, there's enough to put, oh, I'd say, uh, what, twelve feet between each house on each side.
Well, I've got more on one side than I've got on the other,
but I'm like you,
I came down from Colorado
and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard, which here, I look out my back yard and I can see the gate.
I mean the fence is right there,
I mean just don't run too fast,
or you'll hit it
and I'm not used to that either.
I mean I could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me,
but to me, you put the swimming pool in your back yard
and you've lost your back yard.
Entirely.
I mean, uh, sure,
I mean you've got a little place on one side or the other,
but, uh, to me they're not that big enough for a pool,
but, you know, they're going up,
so. But it's, uh, it's great for mowing
from that aspect, you're right.
And, and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff.
But yes,
I'm used to, uh, walking out the back yard
and you can play catch across the back yard
and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball, but, don't do it around here.
No,
the one,
that's sort of what drove me to Denton when I first came out here in eighty-five.
I started looking
and it seemed like the further I got away from Dallas, center, uh, the more lot came with the house and, and the lower the price, at the same time.
And it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city.
I hadn't thought about it that way.
so moving up thirty-five, I stopped when I got to Denton. Uh.
It
well see now, with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further,
but, we we went that way.
It was the schools and the cost of houses,
so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic, time to get into work,
and that's where we stopped.
It was the same problem.
But I think Plano's,
You all both, you all both work downtown?
I got layed off by T I
Oh, well, this is a wonderful thing that, that you're doing here still helping them out.
Oh, I
Uh, but you were working downtown.
No,
I was working at the Dallas site.
My ex-husband was working downtown.
Oh.
But I have, uh, no, T I as far as I concerned, they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned,
so I have no problems.
But as far as the housing, I would like, personally, I would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller.
But prices in Plano, there isn't, um, there isn't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught
and, uh, it, my price right now, for what I pay,
Well, I, I've been, uh, I have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject ,
Uh-huh .
so I'll tell you, is it a serious problem?
Yes,
I do  believe it's a serious problem.
Yeah .
Uh-huh .
However , there are solutions to it.
Uh-huh .
And foremost, uh, where we compare that we are now doing fifty percent of our, uh, people are voting.
Uh, we're probably making a comparison against, uh, some European and, uh, and, uh, uh, s-s-say, newer republics that, uh,  that have very high percentages.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, so, uh, one of the reasons, uh, that, uh, one of the reasons that we could get, uh, one of the reasons that it is lower in the United States is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays.
God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays.
And then we further  complicate it by saying, you know, we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock.
What ...
Right .
Most people, uh, a great number of people now work at various, at different jobs that, if a third of the people are shift workers, they won't be able to get to the, to the polls in any case. If they, uh, have to work late into the evening and not get up.
My solution  to that is that we hold it on Sundays. As do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now.
Right.
Oh, really,
they hold it on the weekends?
They hold it on the no they hold it on a, either a  Saturday or a Sunday,  or at least a day when, when, uh, a great number of people are not working.
Sunday.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
in America that is not true because a, a great number of people work on Sundays.
Well, uh ...
but that is one of my solutions. Uh ...
I , I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, a, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections.
And they, I do not think they have seen a really high  improvement .
Have you absentee  voted in, in  in Texas?
No .
No,
I always vote.
Well, I have absentee voted in, uh, New Hampshire,
and it is a fairly, fairly complicated process where you have to go  pick up the ballot.
Oh, really.
I do not say that it is that complicated,
but part of the process also is that you must register, preregister at some particular point.
New Hampshire is fairly easy
but other states  you have to register every couple of years. And, uh ... Well, to vote, to vote, to just vote .
Huh .
To absentee vote specifically?
Oh.
So registrations are perhaps a, a problem also.
And we're the mobile, mobile society, uh,
Uh-huh .
People are always you know,
one out of every seven people moves every year.
Uh, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every,  you know ,
Uh-huh.
if you compound that, that, uh, eh,
if it is difficult to register to vote, that would remove your eligibility to vote. like speaker is chewing
But I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place,  who , or, who are not just motivated who really believe that their, they, their voice is heard.
Well .
I mean, and the people that I have talked to ...
Well maybe that is another factor , the motivational factor.
The motivational factor is probably ...
Right.
I think that is the biggest one.
I ...
That's the biggest problem.
I ...
Well , that's diminished by,
w-we have noticed this in particular.
I, I'm just read two books,
one of them is WHOSE STARS AND STRIPES NOW?
Uh-huh.
THE, uh, TRIVIAL PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENCY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Oh, really ?
It's a fairly decent book.
I mean  it's, uh, it's preceded by, uh, several other books by these guys.
Huh .
Uh, WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER was about the eighty-four elections.
And I forget what the other books were ,
but any case, uh, i-i-it is, uh, uh, the
uh, uh, there was, uh,
BLUE SMOKE AND MIRRORS was the one in eighty-two.
Uh, they, these guys, uh, have taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections.
In any case, they say that, uh, there's a definite trend, uh, well, you know, toward candidates using negative voting.
It is the only way that you can use television effectively.
I don't understand that.
Why do, uh, is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public? And the public's, uh ,  gullibility ?
No ,
the public  would rather hear something negative about the other guy uh, than, than a positive factor.
And and, you know,
to if you, if you go on the attack, and put some sensational thing before the public, as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign,
and it is not refuted,
people will, you know, uh, believe it.
If you don't refute it, as he didn't, there must be some truth  to the matter, see .
Well, he did refute it.
He , he refuted it,
it just was not effective enough to ...
like speaker took a bite of something Well, he didn't refute it til the last two weeks of the campaign.
He didn't believe anybody would believe that.
And indeed his trend started upward.
Well that see, I, I didn't believe anybody would believe that either.
I, I, I guess I  have a hard time coming to terms with the, the fact that the American public really was, you know, so ...
Well, they do.
Well, don't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability .
And, and, and it ...
Well, then how can a democracy work then?
Well, it, uh,
well, I don't know.
How, how can it work?
Is it working?
I mean that's, that's the question.
I guess the question also is that we discovered, is that they don't throw rascals out.
Everybody seems  disappointed ,
Right .
but they don't throw the rascal out, their own rascal.
Right.
Uh, my, my solution to, to part of this is, is to, to make it a-a-an, an economic incentive for people to vote.
That sounds rather crass, I think, because  then, then you are saying, well, uh, y-y-you  know , y-y, it could be convoluted in many ways where people would actually, uh, by paying them,
What?
I mean, you know, you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever.
Huh.
But , it would be very difficult to administer because I am sure that any time money and votes are involved,
it just, the whole thing  just stinks.
Well,  how about, how about the reverse of that?
When I have heard about England's elections, they are allowed to run for what, a total of six or eight weeks. Even for the higher offices in the, in the land.
What if we totally took money out of the eh, just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue?
I feel like, if , if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count.
Yeah,
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls, a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls .
I don't , I don't care how easy it is for them,
I do not think they are going to because they do no think that their, that anybody listens to their vote.
They think whoever has the
They really think that the packs, you know, no matter what you're promised during a campaign,
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance.
Oh, you mean the special interest groups?
Right.
And, eh, and, eh, no matter what a, a, candidate promises during the campaign, which isn't very much,
any, they do not promise anything specific these days.
But whatever you are promised, they just, they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office.
I mean, I think that's the ...
Well, read my lips . And, and, and no new taxes
and yet Bush did that.
But I mean, but  but he's excused from that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Generally, people, I've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a, a definite necessity to balance the budget.
Well, then why did he say that during his campaign?
Oh, he, he he gave it,
he did  he did, he promised the best he could.
Then he,
it was totally ...
And he is the president
and he should, he should address those problems
and if there needs to be a change in a period of time.
what was so funny about it is that, I guess, that it happened so rapidly, you know.
He knew it.
He actually knew it.
And being  associated with government, he should be held up to the light for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And maybe  he will.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well ...
But I think it is, er-r-r,
I mean,  I think you , you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters.
And he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that.
I think voters are motivated, uh ...
What about, what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about?
Like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts? And, well, the newer democracies
because it's going to be totally different,
but
Well, I don't know if they have higher turnouts  overall.
You do not think so ?
I don't think England has,
I think England has about a seventy percent, sixty-five percent turn out.
Uh-huh.
I think that we just discovered in this, in, in the Indian elections is one of the greatest  greatest and massive things in, in the world.
Oh .
Uh, just, it was, got more violent every year.
Right.
They went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up  Ghandi. But,  simply because people were so   concerned about their inability that to, that their vote does not count any way.  And the corruption of politics in, in, in that s-s-situation there.
Oh, really?
Yeah .
Huh.
But but, you know, everything is relative to when, uh, eh, you know, we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter, right?
Yeah.
I mean is,
but, but before these enormous, before this Voting Rights Act, what we had was a, a great deal of our population, uh, mainly the blacks in the south and the  Hispanics were precluded by,  by, uh , voting laws, uh, from from their eligibility to register.
Uh-huh .
Oh .
Now everybody is available.
Oh .
So, if you really computed it, they probably
when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty, we really only had a fifty percent turnout
because all the eligible  voters
Oh, I see,
because, right.
Weren't
you know, it was skewed  by the eligible voters being less than the total population of ...
were disqualified .
But isn't that , isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just don't vote?
Or is that just the, the truth?
No,
I think the there's a higher percentage in, in certain black areas of voters.
I don't know about Hispanics, you know.
I just,  I, I mean I haven't studied the statistics well enough to,
Yeah .
I mean, I think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction.
Well ... Right,
right.
But you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in Dallas last year.
They have this huge fight going over redistricting here.
Uh-huh.
And at one point they they took another vote on it,
and they, uh, the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to, to pass their plan.
And this is something that had been going on for months.
It was on the news every night.
They, and they have had lawsuits over it.
I mean, it was it was a major issue,
and there still wasn't enough minority vote to get, to pass the plan that they were backing.
So that's,
you know, I think that you have really hit on something there.
to say that, uh, those ...
What do you mean?
Well, with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout.
Maybe it is, is, uh, now that we have minorities included in the ...
You know, Karen, I wonder if we are recording.
Why,
did you not press one?
I did press one,
but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up.
Hi,
my last, uh, auto repair was my, my, uh, alternator went out.
I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota, uh,
it's a little Tercel
Uh-huh
And, uh, I have a a friend who's real good with, uh, repairing cars
so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and, uh, you know, get a replacement part.
Uh-huh.
So we went to a, uh, a, a place called Quality Auto Parts
an, and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and, and everything
and they're, they're, uh, very reasonable.
So, uh, I bought the alternator,
we put it on the car
and it, it didn't work,
and it blew out all the fuses.
Oh, no
Yeah.
How much was the alternator?
Uh, I something like sixty-nine dollars, something on that order.
Did he, did he hook up the wiring wrong?
No,
he hooked it up right.
It, it was just that the, the part just, just didn't fit the car,
so. I took it back
and, uh, he, he took the the guy in, in the parts shop took the alternator
and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
and, uh, he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator
so we, we went back and tried it again, put it on again
and it still didn't work,
and we took the car up to, um, a little place called Pep Boys,
I don't know if you have them in your area
Uh-huh.
but, uh, they're, they're pretty reasonable, uh, car repair place also.
So, uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and, uh, took them about an, an hour to, um, figure out what was, what was blowing the fuse,
and it was, it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse.
Anyway, ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer
and the only problem was that, uh, it had to be a genuine Toyota, uh, alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it, that, that, you know, they sit in there and everything
but there's just some little difference that, um, causes it not to work an
Uh-huh,
they probably built that in so they could make money.
yeah,
I guess so
and that was my, that was my last experience.
Well I had a weird,
there's a little sensing device, uh, in front of my, uh, um, I'm not sure, right in front of the fan,
it's a, it's an air conditioner sensing device.
I don't know why,
it actually,
there's a metal piece that fits through the belts, uh,
and somehow that broke off
and, uh, I, I still can't figure out how it broke,
and, uh, anyway, so this piece obviously, um,
I have a Subaru,
and, uh, I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer, etcetera,
so.
Uh-huh.
Uh, this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks
Goodness,
are you able,
And, and I haven't had too many problems with my car,
I got a eighty-eight Subaru, G L X T
and it,
Uh-huh.
uh, and then, you know just basic maintenance and oil changes
an I, and I do not do my oil changes
and I will not do my oil changes.
I've, I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up, um, trying to uh,
borrowed somebody else's jack
and I did this
and I went and bought everything,
Uh-huh.
so after buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least, or somewhere in there an, and, uh, and then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So that, that's, um, you know,
as far as any maintenance on my car, I, I shy away from the oil changes,
that's for sure.
Uh-huh,
well my car is, uh, it's an eighty-six
and I really hadn't had any, any trouble with it until that
and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it
and, uh, and this was just recent,
so I really can't complain about this one.
How did you put that many miles on it, in, four or five years?
Um, well, I used, I used to work, uh,
it was a seventy mile trip everyday, you know, two ways was seventy miles.
Oh, a hundred and forty mile trip?
No,
it was, it was just seventy miles.
Oh, thirty-five miles each way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, uh, I did that for about three years
and it really, it really added up.
I've only taken, uh, maybe two trips that were about four hours long uh, down to Shreveport.
And, uh, the rest of it was, you know, it's just basically driving a long ways to work.
And now I drive like twenty, twenty-three miles each way,
so, I'm getting a little, a little, uh, little relief,
but still I drive a long ways.
Yeah.
But I guess because they're highway miles, you know, it's not so bad on your car as, as if it, you know, were just regular street, you know.
Uh-huh.
Do you work for T I?
Yes
I do.
Okay.
Do you?
I was going to ask you, you know, as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now, um,
I don't work for T I
and I'm just, I get these green,
I don't know what you want to call them, fake point things,
Points.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I just wondering how I go about getting the cash
Uh, there's a number that you call,
it's the same number that you, that you call to make a call.
Oh, okay.
You, you call that number
and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message
and you can leave a message.
Okay.
I know someone that did that,
you leave a message
and they'll, they'll call you back.
Okay,
all right,
well that's good to know.
I haven't been doing
this is the first time I've been called in a long time
and I haven't been doing it
so,
Oh really.
And, uh, I've done it maybe twelve times.
Uh-huh.
Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much,
but, uh, mine is mixed up too,
I have to call and get it fixed
Uh, let's see before I had this car I had a, um, I bought an Audi five thousand
Uh-huh.
but I bought it, I bought it used.
I, I just bought it from a friend who was going to, who just charged me what the dealer was going to give, give him for it for a trade-in,
and, uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it.
I, I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it,
an I, an I did get a couple of good years out of it
and the, uh, the engine messed up on me
and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the for the Audi dealer
and, uh, he took the engine apart
and, you know, he just said he couldn't fix it
so the engine never got put back together again.
Huh, oh well.
I,
I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury.
Wow.
I think those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you
Yeah,
yeah,
and, Oh, that's when they made cars, though,
I don't know,
this things was, the body was in good condition
and you know, it ran fine.
It was starting to burn some oil.
Uh-huh.
Um. Uh-huh,
And, um, but I had to you know,
you know, I, after about couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car
so.
I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy-four.
Yeah,
well, you know, these, these cars made in the sixties and stuff,
I mean the steel, I mean, the thickness,
I mean, those they're just,
you just don't see cars like that.
Uh-huh.
And they last a long time.
And they were simple too,
the engines were simple and durable
and some people will still buy them, you know,
Yeah.
they'll,
Yeah,
it's easy to, it's easy, I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars, engines and transmissions
and if you, I guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time.
Course I guess I could do the same thing with the, the Toyota that I have,
I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to,
It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it,
you're just better off buying another car.
Yeah,
I guess so,
but I just think they cost too much in the, in the first place, now a days.
So where was your last vacation?
Uh, actually my last vacation was in Connecticut.
Uh, we went home to visit family.
Before that we were in Hawaii.
Oh, I, I'd, well actually I did visit Hawaii once
but I never made it off of Oahu, which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands.
Oh.
It wasn't actually.
It,
when we were in Oahu, uh, I couldn't wait to get off
We, we took a cruise
and we went to four different islands
and it was a really nice,
Kauai was nice and Maui was nice.
We had, we had a great time.
Uh-huh.
We were there for ten days.
Oh that's,
wow.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yes.
So where have you been?
Oh I've I've been lots of places.
My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess
we, that one would count ,
Morocco.
Really.
Uh, that was about a year and a half ago,
and,
No kidding.
what, what, did you just decide to go there
or,
Uh, well my husband is French
and we were living in France at the time
Uh-huh.
and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa
and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet.
And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go
and they speak French
and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier
Uh-huh.
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go.
And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.
Yeah.
Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.
We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.
Uh-huh.
And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed.
We do a lot of traveling around.
We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
Was it hot?
No,
in fact some of the days we froze.
It was,
Really?
well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I was born in Saudi Arabia
and, uh, when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all around you know, in, in Europe and whatnot,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but I was very young
so I don't remember that
and, I was three when we moved back here.
At at, excuse me, at what age did you,
Oh, that's too bad
because,
So I don't remember
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
Uh-huh
and that I was when I was a baby
but so, Morocco I think would be wonderful
because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.
Yeah.
It was a very interesting vacation.
The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
Uh-huh.
and you, there were some places, where people,
Yeah.
there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,
Uh-huh.
and we had nothing taken because we knew
and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.
Really.
But,
We, we found that in Jamaica.
It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that
Uh-huh.
but they, they were so destitute
and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism
and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things
and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,
Yeah.
you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.
The, the worst place was in Marrakech
Uh-huh.
and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad
and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities
and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
Uh-huh.
it doesn't matter who it is
and they keep everyone else away from you.
Oh really.
And it's worth it
and it's like ten dollars a day or something
and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
Really.
and you feel stupid doing that
but we did it,
Uh-huh.
and we were much happier,
Uh-huh.
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, uh,
Uh-huh.
Well that's great.
Where else have you been?
Uh
Well you lived in France,
Yes.
so you've been all through Europe.
No
actually I haven't been all through Europe,  like I haven't been to Italy yet.
No.
Really.
Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September
and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.
Uh-huh.
Uh, my more exciting spots have been,
I've been to the Galapagos Islands.
Really?
Uh-huh,
that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.
Lots of wildlife huh?
Yeah.
Yes.
If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.
Uh-huh.
If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest
But it, that was really, really fabulous
and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,
Now when was that, when were you there?
Um, August, eighty-eight.
Uh-huh.
And then, actually, after there I went to um, Hawaii,
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
making you, um,
you know, get the check and everything is, is, I guess bad guys, if you want to call them bad guys,
they are going to get a gun no matter what.
Uh-huh.
They're not,
I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check,
I think they're going to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something like that.
Yes.
But, but maybe we'll prevent a few John Hinckleys.
Yeah.
I hope.
That's true.
You know, I, I,
that, that's the kind of people,
like I say, I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat,  or, you know, whatever, Yeah.
Knife,
exactly.
He's going to do what he wants to do.
That's true.
I, I just think it makes honest people more honest
and,
And, and the people who want it, it's not that big a deal, like I say, to wait.
Right .
Right.
And, if you have to have it in a hurry, something's wrong
Yeah,
it makes you wonder, what they need it for all of a sudden here. Um,
That's right.
That's right.
Oh.
Well, I'm married to a policeman,
so we, we talk about this a lot
Yeah,
I, I imagine his, his opinion is a little bit towards the one there,  on the scale of one to ten he needs some more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was watching a,
Gosh,
if I was a cop I would be,
worried about that.
Too many people have too many, too much access.
Yeah,
they do.
They do.
and, I guess I think, the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of
I mean, some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out,  that are , I mean, they're are
Right.
basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven
right
or even even the um the little um toy guns look real.
I mean
yes
they that's really gotten bad
I've heard so much about that on TV
and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one.
Or your child accidently.
Yeah.
If your child is old enough,
I mean, there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve,  or fourteen or, and, and, especially some of the minority children. Whether, you know a racist or not,
Right.
Uh-huh.
that's the truth.
And, And if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands
and a cop comes up,
Right.
I mean, you can't blame them.
It looks like they've got a weapon.
You can't ,
Jeez and you can't take the chances.
That's right,
Because there's been kids that age who have killed people.
Exactly.
And, you know, you know, there was a law in, I think it's in Oregon, where they've now made all toy guns,
they're making them neon colors.
Right
and I think, that's a good idea.
You know like, yeah,
and the kids don't care.
That's right.
My kid didn't care.
I know.
He picks up a stick and goes bang.
Right,
right.
It doesn't make any difference to him.
A gun is a gun to them.
Yeah .
They can play with anything and make it a gun.
That's exactly right.
Yeah,
so you like to do,
I think they ought to do that with toy guns,
they ought to make them very reasonably  do something outrageous to them.
Right.
Right.
Exactly.
You know, so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun.
That's right.
That's a good idea.
I was, uh, watching T V yesterday
and there is a town in Georgia,
and it's the law that you have a gun,
every adult, you know, uh, is able to carry a gun,
and,  and they encourage it.
That's kind of ,
They encourage it?
Yeah.
And, the police love it.
Which really surprised me
Um.
and, and, I think, and that's what they were going after, uh, they went to interview this town,
I mean it's a little dinky town,
they went to interview them about the gun control laws
and, uh, the police said, all the people said, that's fine we could care less.
You know, we're all honest, and everything like, that,
Huh.
we, we all carry them,
but we, we don't mind being checked.
And, uh, and I think it kind of took that uh, neatness away from it, you know,
like, well heck, everybody's got one, you know
and, So, it was, it was quite unusual to see the people in that town.
I don't know.
I,
That's kind of an odd thing.
I don't know,
I have a gun
and, uh, my folks have always had.
I learned to shoot when I was real little.
Uh-huh.
I think that's a lot of it too, is that people need to teach their kids,  what not to, what to do and what not to do.
Right.
Exactly.
Because I started shooting, my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B gun,  when I was probably five or six years old.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But, you know, it was,
this is how you hold
it, this is the only place that you do it, which, was,  you know out far and away
Right.
and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here,
and you don't  you don't point it at people,
That's what we're doing.
and then they had,
then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation, I guess,
but anyway the hunter safety program, that you have to do now.
Oh, yeah.
I think it started in about nineteen seventy.
Oh.
If you want, if you want to go deer hunting
and your birthday's after nineteen something, fifty-five or something, then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses
Uh-huh.
Well, that's neat.
or you can't get a deer license.
Well, that's real neat.
And it, and it, it's basic stuff,
it's like, it's don't, you know, when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence, don't point, lean your gun against it, you know,
Yeah.
and then you crawl over it, and shoot yourself.
Right.
And, uh, those things happen.
Well, that's real good.
It, it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people.
Right.
Right.
And they usually are real basic,  common sense things.
Yeah,
put the safety on the gun.
Don't assume, always assume it's loaded.
That's, that's got to be the most common thing that people,
I know
and people don't want to believe that.
Yeah.
It's, oh, it's empty,
it's empty.
Boom!
Yeah,
well see I,
I took the clip out, or whatever
and I forgot about the one in the chamber
Oh.
Yeah,
well we, we're trying to teach our daughter.
She knows real well about, uh, about her Daddy's guns,  what not to do and what to do around them.
Oh, yeah.
Does he got them locked up all the time too?
When he's ,
Yeah, um,
and, and she, and she's real,
um, she'll know,
she'll even tell her friends, don't ever, touch my Daddy's guns or something like that.
Don't even think about it,
yeah.
Yeah.
So, she's real, she's real good about it.
And, she's never been curious,
Um.
I mean, cause he's always, you know,
if he has them out, cleaning them, you know, she can be there
and he'll tell how he's doing it or, you know, show her the insides or stuff like that.
Yeah,
if you make it where it's not something,  Curious,
to be feared
and,
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about.
Right,
exactly.
If it, if it's just one more piece of something,
but they, but they've got to understand, like you said, never touch it.
Right,
they'd have that respect for what it does,  and what it can do.
Yeah.
Ours is a,
we have a shotgun,
and it's up in the closet,
Uh-huh.
and then the shells are in another part
and it's something to think about,
and I got it because my husband used to travel, and be out,
he was out of the country at one time for three months.
Oh, yeah.
And, I was like, I live in a nice neighborhood,
but still,
still
and then I've got it so far,
sometimes I think, I wonder if I, I'm not about to load it because I, you know, I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there,
Uh-huh.
and it's in a case,
and it's, you know, it's put up
and it's away and all that,
Right.
but, I don't want to take the chance
and, I think, if somebody ever does break in, it's going to take me a year to find the shells, and then get it,
He's got to go to a lot of trouble.
Yeah.
hold on,
hold on
Yeah.
He's in here somewhere,
I know he is.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, I know how to use one.
We, we go hunting every once in a while
and he showed me how to use his guns
and I really enjoy it
but, boy if someone did break in, I don't, I don't know that I could or would even grab it
I know,
I, I used to think about that,
it was a lot easier when I was, when I was single,
it was one thing
and when I was just married with no kids, when it was just me, it was an easy decision.
Uh-huh.
That's true.
Yeah.
It was like, you, you come after me, you're going to get it. you know,
Yes,
and now there's so many other things, where are the kids, what are they doing, you know, where is this person coming in from,
Yeah.
Right.
uh, you've got,
and, and, if, if you manage to get it out
and then, you know, what, how can you even afford to, to think about what, what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are, at the same time.
True.
True,
well we, we have dogs that are pretty, you know, very protective, you know
Ugh.
We feel if they make enough noise that,
Yeah,
if they're stupid enough to come through then
Yeah.
It, it,
we have two big dogs in the backyard, and always kind of thought that too, kind of an extra buffer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They've got to be pretty stupid,
and, and most people that, uh, break in or whatever, go to houses without the dogs, luckily.
Yeah.
Anything, that the,
well any, any advantage that they can take.
Right.
And, that's one of them
so,
Unfortunately,
yeah.
Well,
Guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years
Yeah.
Really does.
Well, do you think we've,
Yeah,
I, I think that's about all I can,
Me too, on gun control.
We, we're in pretty good agreement actually on it.
Yeah.
I think we are.
It would be an interesting, it would be even more interesting you, you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum.
Right.
Right.
I'm glad you're not
Me too.
I'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in Garland.
Okay.
Well good!
Well, it's been nice talking to you.
You too,
thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
What kind of lawn and garden work do you do?
Well, right now the place where I'm living, the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years,
so I've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn,
and after three years of working at it, I've, I've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back.
Instead of mowing in the same direction every time, changing, one day you'll, or one time you'll cut it, cut the lawn the long way, then you'll go the opposite way, instead of going lengthways, you go width,
and it helps the grass come back.
Oh, does it really?
I didn't know that
Did, um, you've been working on it for three years?
for three years.
Really?
What have you done?
Killing lots of fire ants.
I was firmly convinced the entire, front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound.
Uh-huh
Because it was like, you could, you couldn't even stand still out there.
You know, I can barely hear you
Is this better?
Yeah,
a little bit, yeah
It was like you'd go out in the yard to water something, you'd just be standing still.
Uh-huh.
And the ants would start crawling up your legs.
It's like, I'm not standing in a mound, though.
Oh, wow.
How did you get rid of them?
Uh, Dursban Two.
Pardon?
A chemical called Dursban Two,
Oh, Dursban Two,
it's a crystal.
yeah,
Dursban will get rid of just about anything, I think.
But um, so you haven't had a problem with that, since?
Um, not bad.
Every, once in a while you'll have a mound pop up,
Yeah.
but that's, to be expected.
What else did it , did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to?
Um,
Not really.
as far as I can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to.
Even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didn't kill it.
Yeah.
Really?
Well, that's pretty wild.
Yeah,
we used it for fleas.
We had fleas in our yard real bad last year,
and we did that um,
I just, I'm not,
basically, I like to mow the lawn, believe it or not,
but I sometimes have problems starting the mower,
so a lot of times I won't get out and do it,
but my husband, basically, does most of it,
and he does the, you know, edging and all that kind of thing,
and we're renting,
and so we don't really put a lot of money into the, uh, you know, like
this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some Saint Augustine.
We just, we have winter rye out back,
and we have,
I don't even know what it is out front,
but, um, we, this is the first house we've ever lived in,
and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, I guess, huh?
So, it, anyway,
Well,
you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard?
Right
Uh-huh.
We were getting,
Uh, I found one thing that, it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn,
but, every time I've done it, it's it, it drives the fleas completely out of the area.
What?
Powdered sulphur.
Oh, really?
Hm, I wonder why it does?
You, you don't have to put a whole lot out,
just if you've got a broadcast spreader I think it comes in a forty-pound bag,
Uh-huh.
and it's real fine, like flour
Uh-huh.
and you just go out, and do the entire yard,
Yeah.
and you, I mean, you don't have to put clumps of it,
just very lightly cover the entire yard.
Really?
Well, I'll have to remember that, because hopefully we won't have them this year,
but we have a cat that comes in and out,
and the cat was getting, um, fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house,
so we had a real problem last year with fleas,
and uh, it was quite a drag because, um, we got them in our house,
and we're Christians,
and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas,
and we got rid of them, believe it or not, with smoke bombs, which is just about impossible to do,
but we did,
and so we don't want them back this year, you know?
so I'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard.
we're almost,
they were so bad last year, even ticks.
I don't know,
we've had ticks before a lot,
and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that.
I think we used Dursban for the, we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing, you know, and spread it all out everywhere,
but that's about the extent of our lawn care.
So, I don't know,
do you enjoy doing it?
Oh, I love it.
My wife can't understand
it'd be a hundred degrees outside, I'll be out there. wife's
But it's too hot to be working in the yard.
I'm under the trees,
I'm having fun,
and I'm stopping to drink water,
so what's the problem?
Yeah,
well that's, well that's funny.
Yeah,
not everybody enjoys it, though.
Everybody has a different thing.
I kind of enjoy it
and my husband doesn't
I kind of have to,
sometimes I'm too busy to get out there and do it,
and he, you know, he doesn't really enjoy doing it,
but he'll do it,
and he doesn't gripe about it or anything,
but, you know, I'm kind of like you
and he's kind of like your wife.
I mean, you know, in that he doesn't really enjoy it,
but I would like to have a garden, you know,
that's my thing,
but right now where we're living we have the trees where their, uh, roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground.
I don't know what kind of trees they are,
but you can't have a garden,
you can't till it,
or it'll, it'll tear up a nice tiller
So we're going to wait until we move.
We don't have a lot of sun, either, because it's big trees back there.
So we're going to wait,
and when we move that's one of our priorities, is to get a house where we can have a, uh, garden.
And so I'd like to do that.
I have a feeling I'll be out there all the time taking care of that,
but that's our next thing
Do you have a garden?
I've got, the,
this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at. Sitting on about a two acre lot now,
Uh-huh.
and half of it's,
the back half is my garden.
Oh, are you kidding?
That sounds fun.
Where do you all live?
Uh, in Missouri City.
Oh, really,
Southwest, southwest side of Houston.
Southwest where?
Southwest Houston.
Oh, really?
Oh, because we're in Dallas.
I guess I assumed you were here.
Well, that's neat.
And, um, yeah
that's what we want.
We have a,
yeah,
that's really what we want,
but we just haven't been able to do that yet,
so one day we'll be able to do it,
and I'm excited about it.
And then I don't know anything about it,
I have to learn,
and then you'll have to give me a call on gardening
What do you do in your garden,
and I'll go nothing,
what should I do?
But anyway, I guess that's about it though.
It sounds like we've covered all the bases
so I guess we'll let you go,
and, um, do you have anything else you wanted to say?
Uh, no,
it's just, I've had an very enjoyable conversation with you.
Okay.
I know, you too.
I hope you have a nice day,
and we'll talk to you later.
Okay,
you too.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, uh, do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote?
I think it's somewhere really close to that cause I think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference.
And they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore.
Huh.
Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked, you know?
Uh-huh.
And so they figure why go out and vote, you know.
They're going to do what they want to do.
They're corrupt anyway
And  I think one of the good ways of solving that is to like, everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and, uh, you know, like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something.
Well,
I mean that's the only,  thing that I can figure out because I've heard so many people say well I'm not going on voting on that one, you know, I, I'm going to go fishing today. Or it won't make any difference if, if I don't vote
and I think it does.
We vote every time.
Well, it, uh, there's no question it does make a difference.
Uh, so far, as having a party and then all voting, uh, when you have different precincts, you would have to have a party in every precinct.
Right.
Because people have to vote in different areas
and, uh, not everyone votes at the same place.
Uh, I, personally, think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up, with the idea of the, the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference.
But,
Right.
And maybe let them have some mock, I mean  uh, you know elections and stuff  and vote for different people in their classes and start really young.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
That's a real good idea.
And, and they are are doing that in a number of schools. However, probably not enough of them, uh, country wide.
But it's going to take at least a whole generation of people, uh, to get across the idea of voting.
Uh, just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally, uh, realize the harmfulness of drugs and  uh, hopefully to, uh, now with the many programs throughout the country on, how to resist taking drugs.
Right.
How to say no to it and what have you.
That,
uh, perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it.
But, uh, I know I, I spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area
and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana, giving away their heroin and what have you, to get them started.
Um.
And, you know, that was in fifty-one.
That's forty years ago that it was already a problem.
God.
So it's now, uh, to the forefront
and people are finally taking some action against it.
And the thing, we've, we've neglected the value of voting. And  uh, and what it really means to vote
Right.
and we also don't make the, uh, the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them.
Yeah.
Well I don't know how it is up there
but down here, Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I'm sure you heard about  some of ours.
Sure.
Right.
And, uh, people are just,
I mean it's like they're turned off on voting.
And that's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party.
Uh-huh.
Okay,
we're going to have a block party.
Everybody's going to get together.
We're going to discuss the different issues and stuff
and then we're going to go and vote, you know.
We're going to go vote
like, maybe they could give something like, uh, the top neighborhood, if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that, you know.
I mean it doesn't have to be, it could be like a, a sign that they would put down at the end of your block. You know, or anything like that
Uh-huh.
but it, it's really bad here.
I mean to me it is.
It seems like people just don't care anymore.
They say, huh, well it don't make any difference, you know.
One crook is as good as the other one.
Yeah.
And they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say.
Right.
And, uh, I know my husband now we go vote every time.
I don't care how small the ballot is, I  mean, if there's one thing, if there's one issue,
Uh-huh.
Right.
because the way I feel is if I don't vote, then I don't have any reason, to gripe.
To complain about it, right?
Right.
Right.
And I hear so many people saying well I wish this would change, I wish that
and, you know, but they didn't go vote.
That's right.
And, uh, maybe if they, like you said, if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all. Then, uh, and the importance of it because, okay, if you don't vote for your friend over here, well your friend's not going to have a chance.
That's right.
He needs your vote just like he needs everybody else's, you know.
Maybe if they were brought up that a way, like you said, it would.
Because I know here, uh, until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines
and you voted for like cheerleaders  and different things like that
Yes.
Uh-huh.
but they should start that a lot earlier.
Yeah.
I,
it's the same way with everything in education though.
It should begin and right down in the first grade.
Uh, and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first, second or third grade. So that the children develop good learning patterns
and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning, uh  and not wait until they're in high school
Right.
and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point.
Yeah.
But, uh, everything should be started on the lower levels
and, uh, certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that, you know, they, they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant
and  uh, but it, but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians.
Right.
And perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run, uh, that only the most wealthy can do so.
Right.
And they're not always the best person for the job.
Right .
But they have the money to be able to do it.
So, uh  so that there are a lot of problems along that line also.
Definitely.
And perhaps the Government,
You know a good idea for the young kids like that too, is to have like a a mock one.
And, okay, this, this candidate tells  you some things that are going to happen
Sure.
and this candidate tells you  some things.
Right.
Okay, then this percentage of the voters, I mean the kids in that class, they are not going to let them vote this time
but they have to do whatever these people, whichever one the other people  elect do.
Uh-huh.
If they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them, okay now you're not going to get to vote
but you're  going to have to do what that person says,
Yes.
they would understand probably by the time they were  in high school,
Right.
they'd be ready to vote.
That's right.
And I think, you know, that's an excellent idea.
They would put them to realize that, that they're going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it.  And that maybe they need to think twice about voting.
Yeah.
Now some  people object during primaries, having to declare a party, whether Republican or Democrat
Right.
and you do that in the primary.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and I don't know that, uh, a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason.
Uh, they can declare anything they want
and they can actually rig it .
If they really wanted to vote Republican, they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat.
But, uh, it's, uh, it's just a sad situation
and, uh, I do think more needs to be done along that line to help to, uh, teach the people, uh, uh, everyone, uh, more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting. So that, uh, we can make, they're making some more intelligent decisions.
Yeah.
And it's going to take these young
I think that sounds great.
you know, it's going to take the, uh, a whole generation of my feeling, uh, before that's going to be accomplished
Well, you know, they'd have to start when they're real young.
That's right.
I mean, you know, it would have to be a child that is just coming into school.
Because, well I'll tell you another thing too now.
Whenever, the first time I voted, I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the  voting machines,
Uh-huh.
now this sounds dumb,
but I did not know how to use those voting machines
and nobody ever showed us or anything
so I didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question, all the other kids  laughed at them.
Yeah.
They thought that was funny.
Ah, she don't even know how, wah, wah .
Right.
Uh-huh.
So there wasn't any way I was going to go in there and vote.
And it took me, I mean it took such courage you wouldn't believe  to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I  didn't know how to work the machines.
Sure.
Right.
Well
sure it is.
Now that's bad.
And I mean I was out of school.
I was a married person.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I didn't know how to work the machine, you know.
And it really scared me, really bad.
Because I thought all these people are going to laugh at me because I don't know how to work this machine.
Where if they'd, if they'd had a class or something or just to a short time, you know, to, said okay, this is the way,
Well, just the, just the opportunity to try the voting machines,
yeah.
Right.
It's, this is the way it's going to be.
And my son was exactly the same way that I was
and I didn't realize it until, uh, his senior year.
I asked him something about well did you, who did you vote for, for, uh, cheerleader
And he said, oh I didn't go vote.
He said, uh, there's no way I'm getting in that machine.
Well then I realized it
so when we went and voted the next time, I asked the, uh, lady, I said I want my son to come in with me
and she said well, uh, why, you know.
He'll have to come back out.
I said because I want him to know how to use  one of these
Right.
and I said, I won't turn any of the buttons down
but I want to show him how to use it so that he'll be  able to vote
Yes.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so he went in
and now he's a  registered voter.
Good.
But he would not vote  before then.
Yeah.
And, I mean, I think that's bad.
Sure it is.
Absolutely.
You know, here I was.
And, and even, of course there's a lot of years between the two of us,
but even with that many years between
Okay,
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next?
Well, what a what do we currently have,
I have a Subaru, uh, G O X T.
What year?
Eighty-eight.
Oh, okay.
Well, I have a ninety Honda Civic,
and I'm ready to get rid of it
Actually,
Oh, it's not pretty old.
No,
uh, well, I I had an eighty-eight that I really liked
and it got wrecked,
and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my eighty-eight
and I've had a lot of problems with this one,
so,
So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of ?
Well, you,
it's, it's kind of funny, um,
I know a lot,
Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, uh, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit, while American carmakers are trying to get their, put together,
Oh.
Yeah.
so.
It's, it's true,
it's definitely true because,
But, but that's one reason
I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru,
that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, uh, for, you know, low maintenance,
so.
Yeah,
well, Honda does too that's why I was really,
Well, really,
there's, there's no question
but you have a nineteen,
I mean, I've got to see if ,
I mean, I've seen and I've had friends that have, uh, like, uh, eighty-one or eighty, uh, Celicas,
Uh-huh.
and those things just keep ticking.
Yeah.
I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them,
That's true.
and they're still beating on them,
That's true.
and it's just amazing
and then they got,
and you know they're not making them like that now, you know,
No,
so,
not at all.
but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system .
Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, because I had, uh, uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda,
and it was the worst car I've ever owned
Yeah.
and, um, that's why, I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda
it was just a wonderful car
and then it got wrecked
and, you know, I wouldn't even look at another car
Yeah.
I just went and bought a Honda, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want,
and I really have had a lot of problems with it,
but I don't know.
Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody
Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty
but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an average of about once a month,
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months
Yeah,
that's a lot.
Yeah,
it was,
I was really disappointed because I was, you know, so, hyped up on Honda,
so.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
Anyway,
so, what's your next purchase supposed to be?
Well, I know this,
Oh, really ,
if you had a choice of your car, what would you get?
Well, it's, this is going to sound really strange,
but I really like to have a Mazda M P V van,
I really like those
and I have kids,
so.
I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that.
They're a lot,
I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van, and the, the new Chevy Lumina van,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I don't like those styles, um, the M P V is more of, uh, uh, just, uh, I don't know what you, normal,
I don't know how to explain, more of an old fashioned type.
I, I'm not sure how to explain it,
Yeah.
I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,
Yeah.
no,
what
Astro, Astro, I guess, is what it, something like that,
Oh, okay,
yeah .
but I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think,
Do you have, uh, do you have a family?
Yeah,
I have a couple kids
Okay,
well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit .
Oh, yeah,
definitely.
But, I know that it's got to have a radio, it's got to have air conditioning,
I'm sure you can, uh, relate to air conditioning Um, living in Arizona,
Oh, yeah.
but, and cruise control and tinted windows, that's about it,
I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I don't care.
Yeah,
well, when I bought my car, it was right out of college
and, uh, you know, I always been looking for something sporty
and I ended up getting, you know, basically something that I could, you know, afford.
Uh-huh.
The only gripe I have is performance.
I probably, uh,
a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, uh, like Mazda R X sevens and stuff
and they're, they're pretty fun to drive,
so, so, I think that's what, uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time around, I keep, I keep holding off
Yeah.
Oh, really?
and then I could, I could upgrade now if I wanted to
but I just, I,
it's just such a huge expense
and, and, uh, I, I'm just going to keep holding off
but I'm definitely going to look for something, uh, in the, you know, nice, you know,
Sports car
I'd like to have a sports car too,
but it's not practical for me,
but,
Yeah
I'm in,
are you still there?
Yeah.
Whoops.
There's some kind of problems.
Hello,
Hello.
are you still there?
Okay.
This is,
something's wrong.
Wonder what happened.
I don't know,
it sounds funny though, doesn't it?
Huh,
anyway, um, but I'll probably, um,
Huh.
it just depends,
I know that's what I want,
but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money,
you're looking at, you know, for a new R X seven or, a Supra or something,
you're looking at twenty-five K or something, that like
Oh, at least,
yeah,
and so, anyway but, Anyway my ultimate car though, the, the one that I really want is, uh, five sixty or so, Mercedes,
I know, well, new cars aren't cheap anyway,
but,
so,
Huh.
maybe someday
Yeah,
we have, we all have those kind of dreams too, don't we?
Yeah.
What I'd really like to have
That's the only one that I, you know,
I you know, I see, uh, you know, early on that, that, that says, it says, you there?
Yeah.
This is strange.
Hello.
Hello,
I think, something's wrong with this.
Okay.
I hope it's recording
I hope it's not my ,
you there?
Yeah
It may be my phone, um,
anyway it's the only car that says, you know, sporty and class, uh,
so,
Yeah,
you're right
Yeah.
uh, kind of what I'm,
but it's,
at the other one my brother's got a Miata
and those are fun.
Oh, those are nice,
And, uh,
yeah,
they're, they're cute cars
Yeah,
well, he did, he had a, a red Miata,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, he actually,
they came out with a European racing, green, uh, Miata that's a limited edition,
Oh.
they're only going to make like three or four thousand.
So, he went out
and he traded the other one in and got this one,
Wow, I haven't seen those.
and I'm like, um , but, uh, I haven't seen one yet either
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel,
Wow.
so, it's, it's very authentic
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be, may be a good investment.
If it,
Oh, yeah,
definitely.
Yeah.
If it's a limited edition usually, no matter what it is, if it's a limited edition, it's usually worth something later on.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I think
hello,
Yeah.
okay,
yeah,
I got off my pace or my cordless phone, anyway, uh, hope it's not going bad,
Oh.
it's going to bump me out.
Um, but he, I think he, he only spent, you know, the low twentys
so, I don't know.
Really?
Now, see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition.
Well, I don't know,
I think the demand's gone all, down a little bit.
I think you can,
the prices aren't as high, you know,
and the, the Miata was first introduced, uh,
And, well , they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they?
yeah,
the demand is so, high that, uh, you know, they were going to retail them around like you know, thirteen standard, you know,
and you get your options, your looking at fifteen or fifteen
Yeah.
That's true.
but there were, you know, people were buying them for nineteen and twenty,
Uh-huh.
and, um, they, they may have gone down a little bit
Huh.
but I,
they're still pretty much in demand.
I think there's another car coming in,
it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata,
Huh.
and I can't remember what I read about that
but so, that's ,
I mean, I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular,
so.
Yeah,
it really is.
But,
Have you seen the new, uh, Dodge Stealth? The, the,  real nice one
Oh, yeah.
yeah,
and the Mitsubishi,  three thousand G T , is the same, same.
Yeah.
Yeah,
the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too,
Yeah,
well, that's, that's, that's the same manufacturer
now those are nice
and so , they just market them.
Right.
Right.
But, uh, yeah,
those are and those are supposed to be very performance power, I mean, they're, there is, yeah, big time.
The expensive ones, they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand,
but those are pretty stripped,
and there's nothing,
there's really,
that one's just more for looks, you know,
it doesn't have any, really the performance that the expensive one does.
Yeah.
You know, but I've seen one of those,
and it's not that great, I mean, because they really,
I think they're only around, uh, twenty-nine K.
Yeah,
like, I mean they have, um, better ,
it's not quite as nice for a little bit less.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they're not really that bad
but I don't know,
like I said it's, it's still not practical for me
I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that
Yeah,
I'm being single
and no other responsibilities for yourself, I guess, you know, it's, I can, I can, I've been pretty happy,
Right.
I've, I've, haven't tried to upgrade myself right now,
that's, uh, you know, I could, I could have, you know, get something nice and upgrade
but I just, uh, I'm consulting right now,
so,
Oh, really?
I just made my first job hop about eight months ago,
so.
uh ...
What do you think about the, uh, Peace Corps or public service commitment?
Uh, that's the first I've ever heard of it.
I haven't heard of it, anything too much about it.
Um,
Well, I think it was, uh, thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft
and people said, well, they, uh, young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country,
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from, um, some sort of public service, like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.
Uh-huh.
And it seems to me that it's, it's not a totally bad idea,
but I don't quite see how they'd make it work.
Uh-huh.
How would they decide who goes into, uh, building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia?
Right,
yeah.
I,
the,
my first impression was, um, it would be very good.
I think it would be good for people to serve,
but I don't know if it should be an option.
It would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids.
And I think there are some available now where they are able to work,
but making it a mandatory thing kind of,
Yeah,
the, the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary.
Right.
And the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft.
Uh-huh.
And some people would get military service
and some people would get civilian, uh, service, like working in hospitals.
This,
I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do, when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army,
they were allowed to do hospital service or, uh, things like that,
and if they
or farm work in World War One I remember uh, reading about.
Uh-huh.
And, and I suppose that there is, uh, justification for taking everybody if you take anybody.
Uh-huh.
But I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them, uh, sorting them out, assigning them, training them would be insurmountable.
Uh-huh.
It seems like you'd have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice.
Yeah,
well it's a possibility.
Yeah,
you know, I'd, I'd much rather work in a hospital than, than to go war
and I'm sure most young men and women would.
And so, uh,
Well, I think that in the, in the cases that, like that, uh, they had to be, uh, pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth, and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war.
Uh-huh.
It was, uh, something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life.
Uh-huh.
Well, that makes sense.
And then you run into, again, to, um, the bureaucracy in running it.
You know, how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
Oh, yeah.
Sure,
and, in addition to that, we have the cost because you have to pay something for, their room and board
so,
Right.
and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend, uh, even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home, you have have to pay them something.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Plus the training involved.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
that would be expensive in most cases.
Yeah,
Because ,
Now I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps, uh, back in the mid sixties
Uh-huh.
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization,
but on the other hand, I'm not sure what the permanent value of it was.
I don't, know what we got for all the money.
Uh-huh.
We had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to, uh, what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh, and to, uh, Algeria and to, uh, Southeast Asia and lots of, uh, out-of-the-way places.
Uh-huh.
But I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went, in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better.
Uh-huh.
Well, I know in,
I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan.
Uh-huh.
And I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me.
It taught me not to be so self-centered and it, you know, to think of others.
Uh-huh.
But I don't know if I was doing it in different situation, you know, not a really religious background, if, if I would get a lot out of it.
You know, I think I did because it, you know, it emphasized that sort of thing.
You know, a lot of self evaluation.
Sure.
And it was definitely voluntary, too.
They were not drafting you and sending you, against your will.
Right.
Right.
And that, I'm sure that would make a big difference, too.
You know, you've got ,
Yeah.
Well, what about a voluntary program?
Do you think that would be a good idea?
Um, well, like I say, I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing.
But I don't know what organization it's under.
I don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private charity that's put it together.
I don't either.
But I know that that helps a lot with training and, um a lot of,
Yeah,
out here in California, there's a program like that for, uh, juvenile delinquents, the, the ones that are not dangerous
and they don't have to be locked up go to these, uh, camps.
And they, do forestry work.
Uh-huh.
They maintain trails
and they, uh, put up signs
and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort.
Uh-huh.
And that I know is run by the State,
but there may be other things.
I'm not so sure what kind of, uh, training that is for the future for those kids.
Yeah,
how much benefit, it'll do them in the long run?
It's probably a, a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble,
but whether it's something that they can put to, to economic use later on is a different subject.
Right,
especially in, you know, if you take a, a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the, a middle of a park,
if they go back to the inner city, they may not see trees for a while, much less be able to take care of them
That's true
Good point oh.
So that's, yeah, so that may not, may not benefit them in the long run.
Yeah.
But,
Yeah,
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to go,
but my other line is blinking.
Okay,
well, thank you.
But it was good to talk to you.
You, too,
bye-bye.
Okay.
Okay.
What's, what's your most recent one that you've seen?
Well actually, what I do,
I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months,
Uh-huh.
so I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater
but I rent probably four or five movies a week.
Really,
I used to do that too,
but I haven't been doing it lately
but,
We've got a good video place out here
and, uh, uh, oh gosh, uh, I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen. Uh,
oh, AIR AMERICA.
No,
see, I haven't seen that one, uh.
Have you seen WILD ORCHID?
No,
is it good?
Well, it depends,
do you like, uh, steamy movies
Uh, no,
not
I know that sounds funny coming from a woman,
but usually I don't
Oh, okay,
what type of movies do you like?
Um, action
I, I guess one of my favorite, well two of my favorite movies is probably like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO.
Okay.
And those are, those are like two of my most favorite,
I mean they're just really good movies.
And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. And movies like that.
Yeah.
Do you like suspense movies
or do you like, uh, just action
or,
Um, yeah,
some, I guess like,
what do you mean
like, like are you talking about movies like DIE HARD TWO.
Oh, JAGGED EDGE,
Okay,
yeah,
I liked that,
that was pretty good.
Um, that was okay,
I, I don't, I guess I thought it was too far fetched
but so many people said oh, no it wasn't, you know.
But I guess,
Oh, well I hope I don't run across them.
Really,
that's true because,
I don't know,
I just didn't find that one to be real,
I, I just thought it was too far fetched.
What was your favorite all time movie?
Um, oh gosh, I I can't think off my head.
Do you know which one yours was?
I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most, uh, that I was really the most in shock with was probably, uh, STAR WARS.
Oh, yeah,
well that's,
When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.
Right.
I mean, I guess, uh, out of all the movies, I've, I've never been as excited to go back.
I was ready to go back and see it again, you know
Really.
Yeah,
yeah,
you're right about that,
but that that's really like an all time classic.
I mean, I don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that.
Now, I, I also liked, uh, oh, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
See, I've never seen that.
Oh, you haven't?
No,
should I rent it?
Oh, yeah.
Should I go rent it tomorrow
No,
that's, uh, that's a, that's a real interesting movie
and it's got a good historical perspective to it.
That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school
Oh, yeah.
Actually, I just saw a movie, uh, called THE LOST CAPONE.
And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers,
Oh, really.
and I won't give the, the whole plot away
but it's, it's really a good movie. Uh,
Al Capone had three brothers,
Uh-huh.
and one of them was lost for many, many years
and, uh, he actually, he turns out to be a law man.
Really.
Yeah,
it's really interesting
it,
Oh, you just gave it away,
I guess I can't go see it
no.
No,
that's okay,
I didn't give away the whole thing,
I just gave away just enough to get you interested
That does sound good,
is it one,
I guess it's a rental.
Yeah,
it is.
Okay,
I may have to do that. Go see it,
or go rent it.
And, a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress,  and seeing like all,
Yeah.
I've seen all of James Dean's movies.  Uh, all of Mae West's movies.
Uh-huh.
And, just kind of, kind of go out and, uh, rent all the movies and, uh, uh, you know, just kind of go,
I guess you could do that, you know, get all of David Carradine's movies,  or, uh, uh, Segal,
Uh-huh.
to,
what's his first name.
I can't remember his first name.
Um, it's not David is it?
Is it David Segal.
I don't know,
he was on, uh, on, uh, uh, Arsenio, just recently.
Oh, I don't, I don't watch that
Um,
It was really kind of interesting because,  Arsenio was asking him about, uh, what he thought of, uh, one of the other action guys.
Really.
God, I can't even remember the name.
He said well, he wouldn't really talk about it.
Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a, uh, a good action guy.
Huh.
It wasn't Stallone,
it was, uh,
I can't remember.
Shoot, I can't remember the guy's name.
But I like all the, the RAMBO movies.
Oh, see, I didn't really care, that's, that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for
but see I don't really like Sylvester Stallone.
Yeah.
I don't think he's really a very good actor.
I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful
but I just have never been a Stallone fan.
Yo, Adrian
Hey that's pretty good.
No,
I guess like I say,
I just have, I don't know, I just have never seen any interest in him,
but.
No,
we, we actually rent, uh, probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.
Oh.
Don't watch really very many horror films at all.
Yeah,
I don't either
You know, I don't know,
there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you, or something, you know,  coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day, you know.
Yeah,
you're right.
Well it's so,
I guess, I'm a real, I'm a realist, and so, when I watch movies like that, it's like this can not happen.
So, I just don't enjoy it, you know, because it's just like, come on, give me a break.
Yeah.
You know, I mean, I just
and so many of them are done so poorly,
Yeah.
you know that, it just doesn't even give you the effect,
I mean some of them are done good
and they do scare you.
But, um, so many of them are just done real,
I don't know,
I'm not really into those.
I just saw, uh, uh, a really interesting movie called, uh, FLATLINERS.
Oh, that was one of my favorites,
yes.
I thought that was a very good movie.
Yeah.
I was really impressed with that one.
I mean it was, what I liked about it was that it was a new subject.
Nobody had ever touched it before.
Yeah.
You know, and it was just, it was done so well, you know,
it was just,
It was just crazy enough for
you know students might try to do it.
You know, I mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.
Right,
well that's probably true
But it was a very good movie.
It was done real well too.
I mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like, no, this can't happen.
It seemed it seemed real,
you know it was really good.
Yeah.
That, that was one, I mean
it's not my all time favorite movie
but it was good,
it was really good.
Yeah.
And, um, I don't know if you like this kind,
but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie, too.
Oh, yeah,
that was a great movie.
Yeah,
I've, we've seen that two or three times.
We waited
and we rented it,
Yeah.
you know, but, but it was really good.
Uh, have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY ?
No,
I haven't,
I don't know if I've even heard of that one.
yeah,
it's got,
It must have, uh, what's his name in it.
No.
No
it doesn't,
No.
Really.
Uh, Hogan?
Yeah,
Paul Hogan.
No,
No,
really,
I'm surprised.
no
it's got, uh, uh, Cheech Marin .
Oh really, that must be pretty good then,
was it good.
Yeah,
it is,
it's kind of, uh, kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse.
Oh
But it was kind of cute.
Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS?
Yes,
yes.
I though that was a really cute movie,
I enjoyed that.
Yeah,
it was.
TWINS was good too,
because when I thought of that, I thought of,
anyway.
Um, oh, there was another one,
what's the one that just,
oh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, have you seen that yet?
No,
I haven't.
Oh, you've got to see that one,
it's really,
I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video
Right,
that's probably true,
that's probably true.
It's, it's very, very good. Very good.
Yeah.
That's another one that,
I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it.
Well my wife, uh, has got a, uh, a picture from Kevin Costner
and he signed it.
It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Really.
Yeah,
and he signed it.
He, he happens to be, uh, a friend of one of her, her business associates. And, or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin.
Oh, wow, that's impressive.
Oh, neat.
So, uh, uh, but anyhow we got, uh, we got a nice, uh, picture
and it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES
so we've got to, uh, try to get out there and see that one.
Oh, yeah,
it's really worth it.
I mean it's a very good movie
and yes,
I would suggest seeing it at the theater.
I know that they're still playing it
and they pushed it back, to playing it in the theaters until like August,
Huh.
I, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in July
and then when it won all those awards, uh, they pushed it back to August,
so. But, yeah,
that one is definitely worth seeing,
it's really good.
Now did you see, uh, DRIVING MISS DAISY?
Yeah,
and you know, I didn't think that one was near as good.
Okay.
You know, I guess it was okay,
I mean it was all right,
but, um, when I compare like the winners of this year and last year, it just,
I don't know.
Maybe, it's, it's not,
Well, um, I'm, uh, pretty pro gun control over all.
I, uh, I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control
and, uh, I must say that there are a couple of arguments against, uh, strong gun control which I find very compelling, although most the people who argue gun control with me I find, uh, use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the N R A slogan arguments
and, um, uh, see I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it. Um,
I guess on a one, a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns
and I have to admit most of that is, uh, strong personal distaste.
I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort. Um,
and, uh, guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me.
Well, me being from Texas
Uh-huh.
I hope you're ready for this.
Um, uh, I'll give it a try.
I've got my Texan stereotypes in place.
Well, I'm not your stereotypical Texan.
I was raised around guns, hunting.
Uh-huh.
So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.
Uh-huh.
I I respect them and what their capabilities are.
Uh-huh.
And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.
Uh-huh.
It's pretty power isn't it
And here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country,
and here, here, here you go,
here you,
this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of.
Okay.
Okay.
When you, I mean, you've heard the, the slogan, um, if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.
Uh-huh.
That applies to anything as well as guns.
a gun.
Well, you, you've got,
well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs
and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such,
Uh-huh.
And they get out their little Mac tens,
they get out their little uzis
and they're going to fight with them.
And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.
If they want it they'll get it.
I don't care if, if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it
they'll get it
and they'll get across the border.
Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway.
Uh-huh.
Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.
If they want to run a background check on me, fine.
If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again.
Uh-huh.
If they want, want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's fine too.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's it wouldn't,
you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way, I would hope. I mean, because I mean someone
the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun
and someone the personal sheriff,
Well,
the only, well, the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has, is this guy a convicted felon? Uh,
is he a habitual trouble maker?
Are we picking him up every Saturday, for a drunk and disorderly
Yeah.
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.
You know, just proving that you're a basically a good citizen.
But if you're not a, if you're not a basically good citizen,
you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.
If, if they want the firepower they can get it.
So why
because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are
they'll get it across the border one way or the other.
So why have any restrictions at all?
Uh, okay.
go back to that one to ten scale where one, being, full gun control, ten being none.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I'd said about an eight.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, we can could be,
I said the restrictions I would like to see on, for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,
I would like to see them go through either,
I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A,
but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun.
You got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon, how to safely handle the weapon, how to properly maintain it, the three basics.
Well, that makes a lot of since to me.
I mean, I certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm
but, uh, I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so.
Well, the
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon, as a, as a pistol.
Yeah
Well, I have a bicycle
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things.
Well, I'm still, I'm still puzzled though, what is the argument,
how does the argument work if, uh, if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway.
What's the point of putting a
basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway
they're not going to take those courses.
Is it, uh, is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?
Well there's,
If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices
does that, uh, mean advantage?
Uh, not necessarily a price thing.
What is happening at least in this state
and I expect to see it in other states very soon,
legislation been introduced as that, if a citizen of the state, being, myself, has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course, I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
You, you're, you're from California, right?
Uh-huh.
L A area?
Uh, no.
Bay area.
San Francisco, Bay area.
Okay.
Okay.
You've been to the city?
Uh-huh.
And all these people come around,
someone attempts to mug me I would
I would,
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade.
Uh-huh.
Now if this legislation comes through,
he
I'm out with my family
Uh-huh.
we've gone shopping,
we're fixing to get in the car,
this guy comes up,
he pulls a blade on me.
I can pull a gun on him now.
When you're, and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick.
What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon?
Then it's still equally matched.
Having, having spent time in combat I feel, I feel it before they'll get the gun on me.
I,
Yeah.
Well,
If I'm, at the same, time.
I'm, I'm sure,
I'm sure given all, given all your training I'm sure that, you know, you'd,
if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have good, you know, far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything.
Um, I'm, quite concerned that if you let everyone
hasn't yet used a gun in a, haven't, hasn't yet committed a felony,
if you let them all walk around carrying guns
in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature.
You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire.
It's, it's hard for me to imagine that a, a situation of, you know,
take it to a logical extreme,
if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.
I, actually it's
it's more of a police action in itself,
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying, well, I'm going to mug this guy right here
but hey, he's carrying just as much firepower as I can.
And if they're if you got to go through a certification course to get where, to where you can carry it in public, then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it.
Uh-huh.
Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not, that's another trip,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh
but.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
In defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat. Even, even more so when it comes to my, my wife and son.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
Anybody, anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink,
I know,
No.
I, I understand that.
What if, uh, what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake?
This, this is where the question of gun control comes in.
Yeah.
Well, uh, that, that was the topic.
What, I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot.
Uh-huh.
Say a person, uh, uh, get,
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up
and say I've got the vibes, this guy's fixing to do something,
I go ahead and pull my piece.
Uh-huh.
And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him
and I will use it right then.
Uh-huh.
If he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me, you mess with my family, I'm going to dust you.
As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade.
And the only reason I feel comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well as, as someone who would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly
and, uh,
Well, if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss.
That's the kind of training I've had.
I mean ...
Okay,
this is really ironic that this would, I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away
Oh, no.
And it's just been tearing me up all day
Oh, I bet.
Because we have just been looking all over for him.
We've been to the pound,
we've been to the humane society,
we've been to the adoption center,
we've just been all over the neighborhood,
we've been calling neighbors
So this is just really strange
Oh, I guess so.
Have you lost him before?
No,
this is the first time.
Um, he's gotten out before,
but he's always stayed right here you know,
Uh-huh.
he's never gone away.
And so this is just really strange, you know because,
What kind of a dog is he?
Um, he's part golden Lab and part, uh, let's see, Alaskan, no, not Alaskan.
I always forget
Yeah.
Uh, Australian shepherd.
Oh,
boy, he's a big one.
he's pretty big.
That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before,
and, I would think, you know, he might, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something.
I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.
Yeah.
You know, but, I don't know
Oh, well, I hope he comes back,
that's too bad.
Thanks,
I do, too
How long have you had him?
Oh, about two years.
So, he's
Oh, that's tough.
Yeah,
it's really,
gosh, anyway,
Yeah,
you get very attached to animals, don't you?
That, isn't that funny how we do?
Yeah.
I mean, we just really,
Well, you know, they're always there for you
and they don't talk back to you
Yeah
And, uh, it's kind of pleasant.
Well, they're companions,
Yeah,
sure,
sure.
Well, do you have any?
Yes,
we have a dog, a little white Lhasa.
And her name is Angel.
And we have a cat, who, a white cat. He's, he's just a Tabby, just a,
and his name is Dominique.
We call him Neek.
Um,
But,
How do they get along together?
Pretty good.
Uh, we've, we had the, the dog first,
and, uh, she's kind of a wimp
and, and the cat kind of rules,
but, uh, she likes him all right.
He, we had another cat about two years ago.
It got leukemia, feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep,
Um.
and, uh, then we got this new cat,
so, uh. I have two children
and they really enjoy the animals.
And then my mother who's very elderly lives with us,
and she's really good friends with the dog.
They're very, good buddies.
Oh, yeah.
That's what are so neat about animals,
I mean, they are, you know, like I said, they're, they're really companions, you know,
and they're friends, you know.
That's right.
I mean, they, you can love them all you want
and they love you right back
and they don't
That's right.
They don't care what you look like, or what you act like,
No.
They just love you, unconditionally.
I know.
It's wonderful.
It's just so neat. You know,
it's,
that's,
I don't know
this is just so hard.
Oh, I know it has to be.
It's just, it's like I said, we've had him for two years
and he's never,
I mean, he's, he's gotten out,
but he's always been right there.
He's never been gone for, at all
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
you know, he's just always been right there when he gets out.
Oh.
You know, it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
Oh, that's really too bad,
that's awful, well,
Uh, I, I just knew today, uh, you know, that we looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place,
and I knew we were going to find him, you know,
and when we didn't it was, like, oh, no,
So I don't know.
Well, I, I'll, I hope you'll find him.
You most likely will.
Yeah,
we keep, you know,
they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center, you know, don't give up hope, you know,
Well, have you put any posters up or anything like that?
We were talking about that tonight since, you know, he, we just, he just got out yesterday
we were just talking about that whether
we, we were trying to find some pictures of him recently.
We've got so many when he was a puppy
Uh-huh,
yeah.
you know, but we just don't have a whole lot.
We have him on film, you know, on the video camera
Uh-huh,
uh-huh,
yeah.
You know, but you can't put that on the
No,
you sure can't.
you know, so So, I don't know,
Oh, dear.
I, we will probably will put some things up. Some posters and stuff up
Well, that's good.
And hopefully that will help, you know, maybe around the neighborhood.
But, we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood,
so that helps, too, you know, if they can keep,
They can keep their eyes open,
yeah.
yeah,
so,
That will help.
Well,
I think that if somebody else picks him up,
I think that, uh, if he gets out he'll come back.
Yeah.
You know. I really do, because he knows exactly where he lives,
so
Yeah,
yeah
he will.
I bet he does.
I know, that it's hard on you.
I know that I'd be worried, too.
I know.
It's just like, it's, it's just so ironic that this would happen
and I would get this, this kind of a call
Yeah,
isn't it, though?
I know,
That's,
it's very strange
but,
You know, I know sometimes our cat will, will stay out all night,
and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know, somebody's hit him
and, and uh, if he doesn't come by mid morning, then I really get scared.
But he's always come back eventually
so,
Well, that's good.
That's one thing about cats though,
they're so small
Yeah.
and, you know, they can get hurt a lot easier.
Yeah.
You know, they can get hurt a lot easier, you know,
Yeah,
they can.
so that would make you really, tend to worry about them you know, if they're not right there
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, but he's a real feisty guy.
He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property.
Is that right?
He's,
cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are.
They just really do not want other animals on their property.
They're very, very
he, he just
any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,
but he'll sit
and he'll watch,
and, I think maybe he would if it came real close,
but he's very protective of our property.
Huh.
That's really,
I, I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,
Uh-huh.
so I never had them growing up,
Yeah.
so, you know, I never really had them around me, you know,
so I've never owned one you know, since I,
Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're very independent,
and they're very, he's very affectionate when he wants to be,
but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be, he'll just, he'll, you know either scratch you or run away.
Huh.
But when he wants to be, uh, he's really affectionate.
He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and, and, and snuggle up to you,
and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.
Huh
But, dogs seem to be always in the mood.
They're always, you know, right there, and like, like you to pet them and loving.
Yeah,
that's true
I, I like the way they come up
and they'll, they'll put their head underneath your hand, you know.
Yeah,
yeah, oh.
that,
and, uh, most dogs do that.
I mean,
Yeah,
they do.
I don't know any that really don't.
I mean, you know, they know exactly how to get that attention, you know,
They sure do.
they just, you know, come up,
and they put your, you know
Yeah.
or they'll rub their, their head against you, you know
Now, do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go
Well, no.
Well, well, he's outside during the day
and then we get home at night we do bring him in.
You have a fenced yard or,
Uh-huh,
Uh-huh.
yeah.
The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.
That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out you know, because he's had all this room to run in,
Yeah.
and, but,
Well, how did he get out?
He dug a hole under the fence.
Oh, boy.
Well, see, he did, he did it a couple weeks ago, dug a hole,
and, you know, we, we filled it back up put him back in there.
Uh-huh.
He did it again
Uh-huh.
so we chained him up
Uh-huh.
you know, but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because, you know, we feel like that's just too restricting for him.
Right,
right.
So, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.
Uh-huh.
Well, he kind of ripped through the chicken wire
Oh.
So I can't,
I, I, I just have not,
I don't understand, you know, because it's, like, he's got a good home, you know,
he's got,
I mean, we have two kids, you know, that just love him a lot,
Yeah,
yeah.
You know, it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out, you know,
we just couldn't,
Well, you know, that, animals are like that.
They like to roam and investigate. And see what's going on.
Yeah
I guess that's,
Yeah,
I guess that's probably true.
I don't think it's anything we did
No.
Least I hope not
No.
I'm sure that, yeah,
No,
I, I know,
I mean he's always, you know, he really does have a good home.
I think that's what really bothers me the most about it
Yeah.
You know, it's like,
How are your kids handling it?
Well, I don't know if it's quite hit him, hit them.
Uh-huh.
I have two girls,
Uh-huh.
and they, they just been real, uh,
I don't know,
at first, you know, they seemed to be upset,
but now it's like, uh, well if he doesn't come home, can we get another dog
yeah,
that sounds like kids.
It's like, wait a minute you know,
Oh.
poor Buddy, you know.
I said, he's only been gone a day
and you already want to replace him
What's his name,
did you call?
Buddy.
Buddy?
Uh-huh.
We, that's was our cat's name that, that, that died.
Is that right
Oh, yeah.
We named him, uh, we named him Buddy after, uh, Buddy Bell, uh, the Ranger baseball player that used to be here.
Oh
And we used to,
we were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games,
and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason.
But, Buddy after Buddy Bell,
so,
That's funny.
But, he was, he was a good cat, too.
We miss him a lot,
Yeah.
and I, I feel real guilty because we had him, like, for six years
and one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster
and he got it.
Oh.
And I just felt so bad,
I, it's real contagious
and it's,
and the vet said it runs rampant in this area
I didn't know that.
and if they don't have their booster, any kind of saliva or anything from another cat, if they get in a fight it automatically, like,
they get it if the other cat has it
so,
I had, I had no idea.
Oh.
I did not know that.
Oh.
It was,
I just felt terrible.
I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was,
he was just getting real skinny. fade
Okay
Okay, uh,
the question was about, uh, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise.
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, I, I don't do it as much as I should.
I try to walk.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, last year I would, I did it every day,
but I've kind of, in ninety-one I've kind of gone down hill.
Uh-huh.
And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to,
but I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier.
I agree
But it's just to get motivated to do it,
and once I get started, and, and, I, I, I I do it every night.
Uh-huh.
It's just to get, uh, motivated again,
and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again.
See that's why I, it's interesting because you have I, I'm going to say you have an accent
Well, I probably do because I've,
And I, and I think that I don't.
I mean to you
but,
you know.
Well, I've been I was born and raised in Texas.
Have lived here forever
so I probably do.
And you're in what city?
I'm in Richardson.
It's right outside of Dallas.
Okay,
my sister, one of my sisters lives in Plano.
Uh-huh.
And that's right outside of,
Well, Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano.
How about that.
I probably went through Richardson, then.
You probably did.
And then I have a sister that lives in Austin.
Uh-huh.
But,
Well, what are you doing way in Washington?
Well, we're actually all from Nebraska.
They just are recently moved there.
My brother-in-law is director of Admissions at the University of Texas in Dallas.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's interesting.
Yeah,
and then my sister works at the Air Force Base.
Uh-huh.
So I imagine they use personal computers.
Actually, yes,
they both have personal computers.
Do they do their correspondence on it?
Uh, I think they just send Christmas letters on it.
Uh-huh.
As far as I,
mostly my one sister uses hers for her children. You know, children's games.
Uh-huh.
Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline
Uh-huh.
and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I agree with that.
Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,
You were?
and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
From what I understand, they act up pretty bad
Yeah,
that's right,
that's right.
What, uh, grade is your daughter in?
My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
Oh, no,
uh-huh.
They always had a paddle in our school.
Uh-huh.
Well, they, they just don't do that any more.
I know.
But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid
and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
Yeah.
Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?
Yes
supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,
and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
Uh-huh.
You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.
I guess we shouldn't get into that
but, um, and what else, um,
I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
Uh-huh.
I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
Uh-huh.
No.
Really?
Oh, yeah,
Ooh.
I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
Uh-huh.
and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
Uh-huh. Um.
Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.
I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
Oh, I do too,
I think they're doing real good job.
Uh-huh,
so.
But, then, what do I know,
I don't have any kids.
No,
none at all
Yeah,
okay,
so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
Oh, yeah
Yeah.
Okay,
well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.
Okay.
It was a joy in talking with you.
Well, it was good talking to you too.
Okay,
thanks.
We'll see you,
bye-bye.
Bye.
Well, what do you know about Latin American policies?
Well, I think they're kind of ambivalent, really.
Uh, I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know.
Uh-huh.
We, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support.
That, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that depend on us so much without, you know, just telling them, running their country for them
Right.
but,
That, that's just it.
It's got to be tough,
but, I mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have to, you know, let them know how you feel.
Right,
I guess my concern, you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, antisupporters, I guess, for lack of better term,
and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody,
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.
Yeah,
it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine from Columbia,
Right.
and uh, you know, of course I, I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us,
Right.
but but that is, that's a tough deal,
That's true.
and it,
I don't think that,
maybe I, maybe it's, you know, I'm reflecting how I feel about it,
but I have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries
and I mean, they've been hammering , for the last, you know, ten centuries,
Sure.
and it's still going on,
and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how, some times,
Yep,
that's about the lump sum of it.
Well, um, I was speaking with a, a woman
from, I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala, or somewhere in there,
no,
she was from El Salvador
Yeah.
and, uh, she was from a relatively wealthy family,
and when, uh, the Contras came into power, of course with,
uh, oh, gosh darn, what's his face,
he's in, in Florida jail now,
Marcos
Yeah,
yeah.
uh, no,
he's, Marcos is Philippines,
Yeah,
um, well, I'm blank on it.
Well, you know who I'm talking about.
I can see his face forget his name
Yeah,
I, I know it, uh,
anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself.
Yeah,
kind of nationalized it for himself,
Right
right,
and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect,
and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance uh, because they were a democracy turned, uh
Yeah.
Dictator,
yeah,
right
Yeah.
basically a dictator fascist.
And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,
it just you know, unstable.
Sure.
Well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico?
Well, I think it's long overdue
Uh-huh.
uh, I just, you know,
there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, I'm not, you know, I have a problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,
there's, uh, it seems like there's,
and I,
this may be unfair to Mexico,
but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in foreign policy a lot of the times.
Uh-huh,
Mexico,
they're, I know they're trying, they're really trying, the Mexican government is trying,
and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to, oh, make themselves Americanized, I guess and, uh, which is great because that's what they basically need to do.
Yeah.
The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know,
Yeah
and we don't have the Siesta,
yeah.
and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, uh, the Mexican people, because they've had their way of life,
and we've had our way of life,
and, uh,
I think their, their version of the good old boy network going that,
uh, you know, has a lot,
Well, let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on?
I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East.
I have to agree with you there.
I, uh, I think that, uh, for once, we should, we shouldn't even be at, at these Mid East talks because, with the exception of our hostages, we really don't have too much of a, uh, real we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is.
Just let these people fight it out
I agree.
you know, we've got so many domestic problems,
and, and what does it cost these people over there, you know.
Absolutely.
Oh, so how about the Soviet Union.
What do you think's going to happen there.
The break ups?
I think that's great.
Um, I'm glad to see that,
but I, again, I don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a, uh, well, uh, a whole lot under any circumstances because I, I don't know,
I'm, I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them,
and so, I'm, I'm not much in favor of it,
but I'm glad to see us advising them
Uh-huh.
that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money.
That's right,
that's right.
But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,
even if it doesn't work, at least he is somebody who, who is working on that problem.
And I, I haven't seen that in the last eleven years,
so they don't seem to have a clue.
Well, all I've seen.
Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of, of, of his political affairs.
I, I think Bush's kind of followed suit.
Um, international is important,
but, uh, we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed.
Uh, you know, and then there's the homeless issue,
and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without, uh, hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think,
and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending.
Oh, I agree.
I just, I think we got, once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the, the world bank, and as far as aid is concerned,
Right.
and I think there's a limit,
and we passed it a long time ago.
I agree.
We've been writing off way too many bad debts
Yeah.
That's another thing I don't understand is, is, is things like selling technology and, uh, even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt
to me that just doesn't make any sense,
as, as much in debt as we are
I know it.
I just, I don't know.
I think it's definitely time for a change,
but I don't see anybody,
I don't understand, too, why we have to have Democrats and Republicans,
and it's either one way or the other,
this it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society,
Right.
you either do it this way
or you do it that way,
and there's no in between
That's right,
you're either liberal or you're conservative,
and that, uh, it obviously isn't working.
Well, I think, uh, it wouldn't hurt,
and I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a, a, a real force in, in the, uh, in Congress,
but, uh, you're right,
there's just too many issues that come up that, uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue
Oh, yeah.
and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, uh, we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed.
Oh, I agree with you.
Well, of course, you know, we have the national embarrassment in our state, Jessie Helms,
and, uh, as soon as, as we can get,
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth, he, he just lines up people against him
so, it's not too, it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions.
He's, uh, usually on the ninety-eight to two side,
he's the one of the two that votes,
He's one of the two, huh.
Yeah,
he's, very ineffective, I think.
Well, let's see,
Senators are in for six years, right
Right.
and, uh, when did you guys vote him into office?
Oh, unfortunately nineteen ninety.
Oh, you're stuck.
Yeah,
we're stuck with him for a little while longer,
but, uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,
so, I hate,
Okay,
well what do you do on your yard?
Well, uh, typical lawn stuff.
Saint Augustine, uh with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
uh, and really all I do to it is,
uh, in fact, I didn't even fertilize it this year,
I just mowed it,
and I, I mow it, uh, you know, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down
Comes back in the yard
Yeah.
so you don't have any one do your yard.
You do it yourself?
I do it myself.
Yeah,
we do too.
Have a lot of people trying to do it for me
Isn't that the truth.
A flyer's on every door every day.
Hey, I need the exercise,
so what the heck.
That's right.
Well, we, um, we, my husband does the same thing,
he does the yard,
and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,
but I keep putting off learning.
Hey, you've got the right idea.
That's right.
But I had recently gone out and planted mums.
We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,
and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's
Uh-huh.
and put out yellow and bronze
and they're just gorgeous, and so then last week my mom comes in town,
and she says Well, those are going to die just the first frost.
She said, You should have done pansies.
And I went, Well, now you tell me.
Yeah
So the first night, that around Halloween
and we went out and covered them with a sheet,
and they did okay that first night.
But the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,
so I guess I've lost them.
I haven't gone out to check yet.
Yeah,
I don't blame you.
I wouldn't want to look at them.
No,
listen,
but, um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here.
I guess it was about four years ago.
And we did not know in August to put down the, uh, whatever it is for grub worms.
Uh-huh.
And the next spring, I guess in that March, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up.
Have you ever seen it what grub worms do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,
it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt.
So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything.
It took a lot of money and a lot of time,
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon.
Yeah,
you, you think that's what it was, huh.
Oh, yeah,
we found them
Okay.
yeah
we found them.
We dug under there about an inch
and you could see them.
They're real fat little white things,
and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
Yeah.
Yeah,
those kind of brown, uh, What we call June bugs
yeah,
but in, but in the,
Uh-huh.
and some people call them May beetles.
Yeah,
June bugs is what I'd heard them called,
so any how, occasionally I find them in the flower beds.
They said that every yard has some
Uh, yeah.
but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.
So that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.
Yeah,
well, I had some of that problem,
but mine was freeze.
Oh, yeah
that too,
two years ago, or last Christmas is that what you're talking about?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
I'm still I'm still replacing that in the back, especially, under the trees uh, you know, kind of slow, and, as you say, very expensive.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I caught Wolfe with, uh, uh, one, uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,
and, uh I bought about twenty of them.
Oh, yeah.
I guess you did too.
It's what they've done in the spring or the fall.
Uh, well, I put, you know
that was late,
that was like,
Yeah,
because I started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it.
Yeah,
that was like September, I think.
Yeah.
And I had to water it, you know
Yeah
gosh.
keep it damp.
Well, my,
out here, you know, we don't have as many trees in Plano,
at least the area where,
we're over by Collin Creek Mall,
and, but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,
and all those variegated, uh, things died.
So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly,
and they just live,
Yeah,
they're pretty tough, uh,
Yeah,
you can, you can stand those.
Pittosporum is kind of borderline here
Uh-huh.
and usually it'll do pretty well,
but, uh, you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals
Yeah.
and it zaps it.
Well it's kind of like one of these,
Oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way.
Same way,
uh-huh.
That, they, they warned me of that one finally.
And I said, You know, you need to either read Neal Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there,
and we didn't know the difference.
And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these mums.
Yeah.
Okay,
next year, I'll do pansies.
Your list is growing,
And my backyard, we had it really nice,
and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy,
and so, it was about,
I guess he's three now,
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio.
Oh, yeah,
oh, gee.
Um.
So, it's like our backyard is just kind of like,
as long as he won't damage it, fine,
and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more.
Yeah,
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
Very much,
but, uh.
I had a, had a small vegetable garden that, uh,
You did.
It did pretty well,
it's, it's like on the side, the apron of the, of the parkway out behind the garage
Huh.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, our, our garages come in from the back, you know, from the alley
So do ours,
yeah.
and, uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there
What did you grow?
Well, I had, uh, tomatoes and, and, uh, uh, peppers,
and I had, I had okra,
That is amazing.
and by the fence I had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, uh
Yeah.
they kind of came out looking like gourds.
Well, put them in a salad, though,
and you say, well, I made it though, at least it's mine.
But I had squash,
I had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,
Yes.
Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite, our total tax burden, despite tax cuts
Uh-huh.
but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in, in the world,
and in
of the matter,
you get what you pay for,
if we're going to have national health insurance, which seems likely, it's necessarily going to involve more taxes.
Uh, I suspect, I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the, the economy, that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, uh, energy taxes, particularly, and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes, that's the direction we should look.
Right.
Well, I guess I kind of have mixed feelings
Um, you know, you always sit there
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it,
and you wonder, you know, where's it all going
Where's it all going?
and we have such a huge, uh, national deficit,
and, and I guess a lot of times there's questions wondering well, if it's doing a whole lot of good.
I know there's a lot of social programs out there that need help.
But you kind of always wonder, well where's, where's the money going?
Well, one, one, one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into, into a big trust fund,
Uh-huh.
but that is a particularly regressive tax, uh,
it's a tax on the first dollar earnings,
and Senator Moynihan's, uh, proposal to, to, to cut there I think makes a lot of sense.
I'm sorry,
I couldn't.
I think Senator Moynihan's proposal to, to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to, going to beef up, up, up the social security program could make a lot of sense.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
I agree with that.
As far as other countries, I'm not, um, I don't keep up on it too much as to far as what, you know, as what they're
I know
we were in Ireland last year
Uh-huh.
and I know that the tax there is extremely high, much higher than we pay here,
but but as far as other countries, I'm not, uh, up to par on
Oh, yeah.
I think Japan, I think Japan is probably about equal to ours
Uh-huh.
and other major countries are higher.
Our friends were amazed that the sales taxes, the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago.
Uh-huh.
And, as a whole, most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services,
and it's a real, real,
Right.
they're, they're real trade-offs there.
Right.
Yeah,
but, and, and you sit there and wonder, um,
I guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general, and, and, um, wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire to live on.
Uh, I,
that's, that's a scary thing that there's no, no real knowing about.
Uh, the, the there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
that's true.
But, um, are you involved with the legislature up there,
or which,
No,
I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Uh, part of the Commerce Department. Here in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
I was just wondering since you said Washington D C,
and you, and you picked this topic,
I was just kind of curious.
Well, well
I, I, I didn't pick it, uh
Oh, you didn't.
I mean, um, I, like I don't really recall.
I may have filled out on the, on the form,
but I, I certainly, certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before.
Oh, did you.
See, I haven't placed any calls.
Did they automatically assign the topic?
Yes,
yes,
when you place a call topic is given to you.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I thought whoever made the call could choose what topic,
because I haven't made any calls yet.
I've just received some.
Oh, you should try it.
Oh, I didn't realize that
Okay.
Yeah,
because it's kind of a, it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to.
Uh, many of the subjects are. Uh, taxes, taxes especially.
Um, one thing that has kept our tax burden high, and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the, is the level of of the defense budget
Exactly.
and that's, that same subject,
Hello,
my name is Donna,
and I'm calling from Plano, Texas.
Hi,
this is Laurie,
and I'm in Garland
Oh, okay.
Um, would you like me to go first?
Sure.
Okay, um
I have three children, um, two, two who are in regular school, uh, eleven year old, an eight year old,
and then my little one, three year old, is in, um, a University of Gymnastics,
it's a, a preschool
Uh-huh.
and, um, I think it was really hard to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out.
I guess you can classify them all together.
Uh-huh.
Um, some of the qualifications that I look for was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were, and if the place was clean and um, the hours
Uh-huh.
and, um, just, just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff.
Right.
Well, we don't have any children,
but we're going to have one next year
Oh, congratulations.
Thanks.
So, um, that's something that I'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future.
Right.
We haven't quite decided if I'm going to,
I'm working part time now,
and I don't know if I'll be doing that or what we're going to do.
Or staying home.
But if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody,
and our church has a Mother's Day Out program which they started last year,
Uh-huh.
and we know a lot of people at the church
so I would feel very confident with leaving my child there
That's a very good place to start I think.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
the Mother's Day Out programs,
and that's where Shannon had started, in a Mother's Day Out program
Uh-huh.
and, uh, the churches always have I think, a, a pretty good program,
and you have to make sure that you, um, that you apply pretty early, because they do have, a lot of places have very long waiting lists.
Uh-huh.
And, um, and another question to ask is if they're, um, state certified um, you know, if the teachers have, um, their Master's degree in, in child education and um, child development.
Okay.
Uh-huh
Um, you know, what, what kind of a structure is it going to be.
Um, when your child's a little bit older, like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap.
Uh-huh.
Is there like a mandatory nap time?
Time, uh-huh.
What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going,
and if, and they lay on these little mats,
and if they fall asleep, they kind of let them sleep,
and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones,
and the other ones get up and go do something else.
Uh-huh.
So, she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know, which is, which is nice. Um.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Um, you know, it's kind of scary, I guess, because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately,
That's true.
and so, it's, I guess it's such a growing concern,
but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear.
Right.
And sometimes when the child's a lot younger, before they're really, um, before three years old, you know, like the church is a good program
and sometimes you even consider, um, you know, having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that,
Right.
and another consideration is how many infants or children are they, what's the ratio of, of teachers to to children
To children.
Right.
because that makes, a, a, a difference,
and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day,
just your child, and, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,
Uh-huh.
you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time, and not have another child use that bed you know.
Right.
Right.
I'm sure that, um, whatever you decide, you'll be happy with.
Yeah
And it's exciting time to have a new one
Yeah.
We're pretty excited.
I bet.
That's, that's wonderful.
Yeah,
but that, you know, we have been thinking about that,
but it's a little ways off in the future
Uh-huh.
but, um, I figure, you know, I'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be before they, you know, before you can bring them in.
Asking.
Right.
Some, some places, um, start them as early as, I think, well, some, some places take them as infants, I guess, you know, like eight weeks, even.
Uh-huh.
Um, there's a place to look into, um, um,
a friend of mine who's a nurse is, was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in, on Fifteenth Street,
up,
it's in Plano somewhere where, um,
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants, infants and then only up to like two years old
Um.
and it's, it's supposed to be really a, a,
you know, some places just specialize in just real little ones
Right.
and then other ones, uh, are the older children.
Uh-huh.
But it is a difficult situation, I think.
When they're, when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry,
Hi,
my name is Donna,
and I'm calling, calling from Plano, Texas.
I'm Jay in Dallas.
Oh, okay, um,
I, um, find exercise kind of a task, I guess I'd say.
I go to aerobics two days a week,
but I also have three kids at home
so they keep me pretty busy.
That keeps you plenty of exercise .
Yeah,
that gives me plenty of exercise,
but I enjoy, um, walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family.
Excuse me sound as if hand over the
That's fine.
And yourself.
Well, I, uh, I have,
I walked and run um, almost every morning.
I've sort of stopped here with the weather change,
but, uh, it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning.
Uh-huh,
every morning.
Well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves doing
Oh, that would,
that's fantastic exercise.
yeah,
he does it every day like a ritual.
Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go,
but he goes, um, every, every day,
and then he he's a runner, too.
He runs three mornings a week
he gets up about five and, and does his, his deal,
Um.
and some days he doesn't,
but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run.
All right.
And, um, we .
I'd rather get a bicycle,
but I have an I had an exercise bike in the house, but didn't seem to use it enough,
so somebody sold it in a garage sale,
and so, uh but I'd like to get a bike and just do, uh, do biking outside.
Oh.
The, the, the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here,
and I know, um, uh, we, we both of, my husband and I both do it to just keep the pounds off.
We're getting up in age, I guess, in our late thirties
so we need to keep exercising just to be able to, uh.
Yeah.
It keeps going,
because I'm fifty-five,
and it, uh, it just gets worse.
You still want to eat,
and, uh but you just,
Oh, I know.
I think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,
but, uh.
Yeah,
I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week,
and I take my three year old with me.
There's a nursery there.
And it's kind of another day out for her to, um, have little friends,
Uh-huh.
and, um, I, I enjoy the socialization of it, you know,
getting to see the same women every morning,
Right.
but um, there are some parts during that exercise that I think, I cannot do another second of this.
Oh.
I know it, it, it, some of it is so tough
It is.
and, uh, especially when somebody's, uh, planning lunch for you and they know what, what's good for you,
I think when we do it ourselves,
we take the easy way sometimes.
That's true,
that's true.
So.
Well.
So anyway
Okay, well.
thank you for calling.
Yes,
thank you for participating.
All right.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Well, uh, guess it's logical to ask, do you exercise any?
Well, unfortunately very little.
Uh, much less than what I need to.
I'm about the same way,
I, I do a little bit.
My job kind of hinders me from exercising.
I'm a night operator here at a industry down here
and I don't really get out a lot to, because my job, to, to exercise.
Well, I, uh, am an assistant teacher and, uh, in business technology
and I've, I think the most exercise I've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions.
It keeps me pretty busy,
but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going.
Right.
And, uh, you know, it really,
exercise is so important.
It is.
And I realize that.
That's, that's the way I feel.
I'm used to being in pretty good shape because when I was in high school I stayed in pretty good shape, played a little basketball and stuff like that,
but I've got,
now, I'm in college
and I go to school during the day and work at night.
I can tell that I've not really done a whole lot.
When you, uh, exercise, what do you do?
Do you do it at home or a club
or,
Well, uh, I usually, I usually play at home.
We live out in the country
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play
or a lot of times we're, we're up at the church
we'll play volleyball
stuff like that.
I got a hold of, uh, Richard Simmons' tape, uh
Oh, really?
what is it, uh,
I can't even think of the name of it right offhand, with the oldies.
Oh, the SWEATING TO THE OLDIES?
Sweating with the, to the oldies, *title
yeah
and that's not bad.
Oh, really?
That's pretty upbeat,
so, you know, I, every once in a while I'll put the cassette in and go with it.
Right.
Not often enough to have a routine
Right.
I'll,
My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her.
Oh, really?
But, uh, I don't know,
by the time I get home, all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer
and my fingers exercise more than anything now.
Right,
that's the way I am.
I just want to sit down and relax.
Too tired to exercise. *slash error I did.
Yes.
Uh, do you ever ride a bike or anything like that?
I started riding my bike about a couple of months ago
and I'd ride about two or three miles a day,
but, but it would last about a couple of weeks
and it got real cold for a little while
so I gave it up.
Here, about the, the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk, uh,
Walk around.
Because they're enclosed
and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and, and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter.
Right.
Right,
I've noticed people doing that down here, too.
I'll be in town or something
and people will walk around the mall.
And it's safe.
It, it is fairly safe.
That's, uh, you know, inside the mall
may be not safe going to the parking garage
Yeah,
certain parts of it.
I know a doctor once told me it, it,
a friend of mine, uh, suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is.
Right.
Right,
I used to do a lot of swimming,
we have, we have a swimming pool,
but it's an old concrete pool.
We've been having trouble with it the past few years,
so we haven't got to use it much,
but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that.
The, uh, swimming, they say, uses more muscles than any other exercise with,
and the water takes the resistance.
Right.
Right,
and you don't get the soreness.
I've, I've done some water exercises,
but our pool is not, is not heated
so it's,
Right,
you can't do it year round.
Summertime only.
Right,
that's the way ours is.
You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees, go out to the swimming pool.
Oh, no,
it's too cold.
Hot tubs are not, uh, not too bad,
but
I could deal with a hot tub.
Those are nice.
So, what part of Mississippi are you from?
I'm from Laurel.
Whereabouts is that?
That's way down towards the south.
Not quite on the coast,
but we're about two hours from the coast.
Oh,
and you do have cold weather down there?
Yes, ma'am,
it, it started about yesterday, I believe.
It started raining and got real cold.
Ours started Thanksgiving.
Oh.
And, uh, from there just, well,
today was pretty,
but, uh, oh, Sunday the snow and ice came in.
Right.
And, uh, there was no exercise.
They tell you what our topic was?
I think golf, isn't it?
Right.
How much of a golfer are you?
Are you a hacker?
You bet.
I'm fifty years old,
I've been a hacker,
I think, I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than I play right now.
I know I, Oh, I know I did,
I know I did.
And, uh,
Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, you know,
and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body.
Oh, I know,
it's just unreal.
I, you know, I'm a guy that plays,
if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year
and that's about it.
I figure that's my retirement game.
I really,
I come from a family of golfers.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.
Sure.
And my mother who is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap,
but, but, uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every,
they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.
Yeah.
That was their deal,
they,
That's what it takes,
you, you need to play that often to get a really good handicap .
But, uh I just, I just never could do it.
I have a brother-in-law who is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.
Well, I went to,
I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more
and I, I went after it
and did, and I really didn't find much improvement.
Fact, ever time I'd start trying to correct something, it seemed like the score would *listen go, go back up,
Oh, really?
yeah,
I, I think I need to, uh,
Yeah.
I probably need to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.
Yeah.
Spend more time on the,
I think I'm probably the same way.
Lessons do help.
I know ever year we buy,
I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner,
it's a hunter's type affair
Uh-huh.
and I buy in, in Austin, Texas,
I go down to Austin,
I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine
Uh-huh.
and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill country. You know, at, uh, Horseshoe Bay.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah,
I'm familiar with it.
And we just have a ball,
and we play three days in a row, three different courses
and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, uh, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five.
So,
Oh, yeah,
if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference.
You bet,
so it, that makes a lot of difference to me.
Yeah,
yeah,
I, well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly
and when I am doing that, uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better,
I, I, I get through the ball better.
Uh, and I also, if I,
I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance.
You bet.
And I,
my control is a little bit better there.
Yeah.
Uh, so,
That's super.
I haven't learned to hit the ball easy
and I just sort of,
I'm always wanting to hit it hard
and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, you know, just to relax and hit the ball,
and, you know, so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, you know, a lot of my energy's gone,
when I do swing it's an easier swing
Uh-huh.
and I do, actually, hit the ball better.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron?
No,
I have a two through, you know, two through wedge.
I hit a two iron awful lot.
Off, now, off the tee.
Uh-huh.
I don't hit a driver off the tee.
That, that's why I need my driving lessons.
Well, you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too,
and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver.
That helps.
Uh, I had a lot more control on it, uh,
I sacrificed distance,
but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.
Well, that's, that's a good idea.
I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more
and I'm going to do the same thing.
I, I laid off my woods about three years ago
and I just use a two wood off the fairway
and I'm a fairly strong person
so I get a pretty good little drive
Uh-huh.
and I, and I guess control my irons, better, you know,
if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.
Oh, yeah,
absolutely.
And, uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son
so, but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play.
Yeah,
well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more.
If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice uh, range.
Right.
Uh, I think there is less frustration factor there, too, uh,
Makes good, makes good sense.
So, but I, I,
the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start.
Apparently they're very difficult to play with,
but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.
And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron,
it's incredible.
Oh, yeah.
And, but, and his accuracy is what's so startling with it.
And I,
and it, but it's an iron that he's really practiced with.
He has used a lot,
and, uh, it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron. Uh, distance iron.
You bet.
My my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be great after that
That, boy,
I just,
if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know
And get away without embarrassing yourself,
right
Because,
Okay.
Well, do you exercise regularly?
There is,
well, I am a school teacher.
Uh-huh.
And, us,
there is, uh, uh, girl that went through our school district, I teach in Highland Park who, uh, does aerobics at the Y C A and I say Y, the Y W C A
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
to someone else in the turn that off please,
I am recording. talking to speaker
My husband just turned on something noisy.
Uh-huh.
Any way, uh, she comes to the school
and there are a group of teachers,
and we exercise regularly and, uh, for an hour
Uh-huh.
and we do it twice a week.
Oh. That is good.
And, uh, we do, uh, aerobics, for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes
and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes.
Uh-huh.
Uh.
So it is an hour.
And then my husband and I take, uh, ten mile walks, uh, as often as possible.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, not on the nights that I do aerobics,
but if, if he wants to, he jogs,
but I, uh, I, we take the fast walks
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house.
Uh-huh.
And so, we, we, take it seriously.
We enjoy doing it.
I enjoy my group at school.
It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh, well I use to exercise regularly
and I haven't lately
Oh, oh
I have goofed off, I guess.
Uh, I use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I guess my job change, my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more.
Oh I understand that.
So, uh,
I have never been able to do it before.
Well, the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day,
I just want to go home and not do anything.
Well, I and too. I just make myself.
Yeah.
I get up at five thirty
and I am at school at seven thirty.
Oh.
School is not over until, uh, four
Uh-huh.
and our class,
but it is in the building
Oh.
that is the big difference
because there are other people around that, uh,
you had better hurry.
Go get dressed.
You know, there is motivation around there
and then, uh, we, we can change right there in the building.
I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere.
Uh-huh.
And I just go
and we, uh, exercise.
And until then, you know I have belonged to exercise clubs
and oh I have gone to, uh, oh, like, uh, oh, these gyms, you know that the, like in Plano and Richardson and, uh, where they offer the, uh, rec centers really where they offer aerobics
Uh-huh.
and I have done that before, but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner
Yeah.
and you are just kind of going Ugh.
And I have tried it immediately after school
like, try to get some place and exercise from five to six,
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late.
That is right.
That is right.
That is a .
It is.
It is really hard with our life style when you work to,
Uh-huh.
Well, I know, some people go during lunch,
but, you know by the time I get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work, it is probably two hours or more
Uh-huh.
and that is just too long.
I have twenty-five minutes for lunch.
Yeah
That is out for me.
That doesn't really do it, does it?
No,
I don't think so.
Yeah.
But, uh, and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually, uh,
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.
You know, cause they know we are in the building and coming. Where as, at, uh, another place, you are paying a lot more money
Yeah.
and, uh, it does going to start whether you are there or not
That is right
That is right.
So this has worked out real nicely.
In fact, she charges us two dollars a session.
Well, that is not much.
Huh-uh.
So it's, it's,
we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in, uh, uh, school uh, report card period
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks.
Oh.
That is not bad.
Huh-uh.
It beats memberships at some of these clubs.
That is for sure.
You are not kidding.
They are real expensive.
I know.
We belonged, uh, for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year.
Uh-huh.
I mean, we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership
Oh.
and at first we used it
and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth.
Yeah.
And they offered lots of things,
but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to.
Yeah.
So we decided to forget that.
Uh-huh.
That was just a waste of our our money.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well we have one through work
Oh no.
But, I, uh, I don't know
I still just don't don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or I don't know something,
but I need to do something.
If, if its only walk the dog or something.
Uh-huh.
I need to start doing that.
It does make you feel better.
The hard thing is getting going.
That is right.
And if you have somebody who will do it with you,
like, for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to, uh, jog
Uh-huh.
but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,
What are you guys having for Christmas?
What are we having?
Let's see
Well, I'm not planning the menu.
Oh, you're not.
No
We usually go out to either one of our folks,
they both live close to
Yeah.
but, um, I don't know,
it seems like a, a big thing for Christmas is usually ham.
Well, funny you should mention that.
I'm a pig farmer
Oh, you are
Yeah.
huh.
Well, now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else,
but we're going to have, uh, wild boar
My goodness.
we, uh, we killed a boar the other day,
it was, you know, mating with the sows,
and you can't use the piglets, you know,
so.
Huh.
It's about six months of no use,
so, we, uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, you know, processed into ham,
and, uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia
Oh, really.
and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him
Is that, is that hard?
Well, no,
hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap,
I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
you just, uh,
you kill him, you know,
you probably,
most guys just shoot them in the head,
they go, you know,
in a second they're gone
Oh.
and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use *more than one utt??  and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.
Huh.
Oh, my goodness.
And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there,
and it's the best eating you ever had.
Oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?
Yep,
just like a pig
Does it.
I mean, you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.
Huh.
This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds
Oh my.
and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, you know, we took the skin and the head and the and the feet off,
and that was about, you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham.
Oh, well, how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas?
Oh, well, we're, you know, we're not going to eat the whole thing
Eat it all,
yeah
It would take a year.
But, uh, you know, we're going to drive up to Kansas City, see my wife's folks,
and, uh, she, she,
what's, what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas
yeah,
well her mom's doing brisket.
I don't,
what is brisket?
Brisket?
It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away.
Huh.
It's just tough as a boot
Oh.
and, uh, you know, they used to use it for leather, I think
Oh, my goodness.
I mean, no,
I was kidding.
Yeah.
But, uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, you know, the rib cage,
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of, gristle where it attaches to the ribs,
so it's really, really a tough piece of meat
Oh, my goodness.
but it's so tasty, you can't stand it.
Huh.
So you just take it
and you marinate it for a couple of days
And that softens it up, huh.
Huh.
And then, uh, you just put it in the oven,
takes about four hours to cook one.
They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.
Oh, gee.
And, uh, we're going to have that.
Well, what else do you serve with your pig?
Oh, well, we'll have cranberries and hominy
and, uh, we, we are, we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here.
Huh.
We have olives, black olives and cucumbers and, uh, tomatoes,
we still have tomatoes
Oh, do you?
yeah,
fresh tomatoes.
Oh, we, we just got lots of snow
Well, it started to freeze up around here, you know,
there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire, and half of that's down.
I mean it's thirty degrees this morning.
Oh, really.
Yeah.
Huh.
But, uh, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost.
Oh, my goodness.
I didn't know it got that low at night.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's desert, you know,
where, where we are, it's, it's, it's, uh, the edge of the desert,
I mean, it's part of the Great Plains.
So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten
Oh, gee.
and at night it goes down to about sixty.
My goodness.
Yeah,
we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours.
Oh, boy.
So everything that lives around here is real tough
Oh
That's trees, you know,
we got hundred year old trees that are, you know, twenty feet tall.
Oh, gee.
That's all the bigger they get,
they, you know, they're just hard as a rock.
What, what,
how do you get your main source of current events?
Well, uh, until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL,
and I thought that was a good way,
but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things.
You know, it's a week or two late,
but, uh, that's how I'm staying up.
I either watch the news
or, or occasionally I'll read the paper.
Uh, do you like how it's presented on the news?
Um, no,
I think the media's a little bit too manipulative.
They allow you, uh,
they, they try to lead you too much, I believe,
and sometimes they're not very open,
I, I don't know,
I think they're a little bit biased sometimes.
Like for example, the Kennedy, the Kennedy rape case.
The coverage on that was, you know,
when it first happened it was, he was guilty, he was guilty, he was guilty.
You know, they try to have you form opinions or whatever,
and then I, I didn't like the the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that.
You know, basically I, I, I think they don't present the, the whole sides of, of everything.
So, it, it makes you feel like they're, uh, wanting you to take their opinion.
Right.
It's, it's, it's, instead of reporting the news, it's more like an editorial, I believe on a lot of issues.
Yeah.
I've noticed that too,
and it's kind of distressing, isn't it?
Yeah.
And they just, I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words, uh, usually, uh, just that sway the whole, uh, report that, you know, by just a couple of words.
Well, when, when I was in school, I, um, I was a communications major,
so I, I, I'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking, and, and so forth
So, communications, huh.
Were you looking into becoming a reporter
or,
I was,
and, um, I I ventured off in a whole entire different field, field.
I went with the state.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I, um, went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability,
calculate benefits.
I bet that's a interesting job.
Yeah.
So the,
so, and, you know, working, you know, working for state government you hear all about current events, about things going on within the state itself.
So that, that's another source that I, I, where I keep up with current events
and,
Yeah,
there's one that I'm reading right now.
It's INFORMATION WEEK.
It says A T and T to account for the, the benefits that the A I C P A now says you have to show as a liability.
It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three, to account for that.
It's a lot of money.
And it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more.
It's a lot of money.
Yeah,
it is.
And, yeah, you have to stay up on stuff,
and I bet in your, your job that you have to,
do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL?
No,
well, no,
I, I, I primarily deal with the state employees,
but I, I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the, like the state of North Carolina's budget, and stuff like that.
And I really know what the budget is,
and, and, uh, uh, when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes, and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that,
and, you know, I'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has,
and it, it's just funny.
You know, so that's, that's, that's,
so I don't have a whole lot of faith in, in, you know, the news.
Course it's,
they, they get what they hear from,
but, you know, it's not always I, I think one hundred percent reliable.
Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective?
I think they need to do a little bit, go into a little bit more depth, uh, before they would just report, like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that,
because I mean, another example is the, uh, AIDS issue or whatever.
You know, someone said, Oh, I found a cure.
They immediately,
the headlines on the news or whatever is, Someone says they found a cure for AIDS.
And then two months later it's discovered it's not, you know,
before they, before they come out with something like that they need to, to research the matter, I believe, a little bit more.
I guess they do that so they don't get scooped, you know,
so they have the big story.
Well, that,
well, yeah
I, I,
it,
I think the,
Let's see, *something missing? A.1?
my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,
but, I, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,
Uh-huh.
I'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas,
but basically he does all the heavy stuff,
and I do all the fun stuff
Well, we have it just opposite here.
My wife works in, you know, at, at, at the T I,
and she's, uh, sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow.
Uh-huh.
I see.
And we have about ten acres,
and she tries to mow about half of it
Wow.
Wow. That's a, a big job.
Well, yeah,
it keeps, uh, well,
it's doing real well,
because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed
Uh-huh.
I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
Uh-huh.
and now, you know, since we've been mowing it,
and, you know, of course we water a little bit,
that's just too much to water all at once,
but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
Oh, sure.
Oh, I bet it's beautiful.
Yeah,
but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers.
We have one little flower garden that we, that we work with.
Uh-huh.
The rest of it is just like wild flowers
Wild flowers.
and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
Uh-huh.
They're about, oh, I guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand
Uh-huh.
and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush.
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Uh-huh.
Oh, the wild flowers are beautiful.
I think, um, I was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets
or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.
Then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved.
Yeah.
Well, my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh, she enjoys mowing.
I can't believe it.
Uh-huh,
I know a lot of
I mean, I hate it
uh-huh,
a lot of women do. Um,
I've just never really, you know,
maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow,
but, um, my husband takes it on,
and I'll help rake up the grass,
and, um, sometimes I'll help him edge, um,
because, we don't have that much property,
but we're on a corner lot,
so there's a lot of edging to do
Right.
and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country,
you don't have to worry about any of that
We don't even have any concrete or asphalt.
Oh.
Oh, that's nice,
I,
this is different for us because the other,
in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks,
and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees,
and we do miss that.
Um, if we had a chance to move, I think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as, as far as that goes.
Uh-huh.
Yeah
but, you know, we do everything together.
Uh-huh.
This, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the,
actually this fall, I was talking about,
two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
Oh.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we're in the process of, of planting
Wow that's,
and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line
Um.
and I, uh, I think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
Uh-huh.
Right.
So.
Right.
Well, I put,
On the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums,
and we have morning glory
Uh-huh.
and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,
and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water
Uh-huh.
and we get hummingbirds come in the spring, you know, all summer long.
Oh.
Oh, that sounds so pretty.
And, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
Oh really
Do they, don't do any damage, though,
they just fly right back out, if you have the,
Well, yeah,
they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
I see.
and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.
I see.
And we got a few, you know,
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
Uh-huh.
But, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is,
well, we got asparagus,
and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries.
Uh-huh.
Man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.
Oh, oh, that sounds wonderful.
We just got our last tomatoes.
Oh, I love home grown tomatos.
Yeah.
There's nothing like them.
They just don't have the same ones in the supermarket
Well, these are accidental tomatos.
What does that mean, accidental tomatoes?
Well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes,
of course you're going to lose some that way
Uh-huh.
and the seeds go right through them.
I see.
And wherever they pooped,
What are your favorite shows?
Well, I, it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V,
but the ones that are out now.
Uh-huh.
I, I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times.
I think that's kind of a good show.
I've never seen that.
Haven't you?
Huh-uh.
Oh. I like that one,
and, um, I'm trying to think.
I, I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch.
How about you?
Um, I like L A LAW not because it's realistic, but it's entertaining.
Oh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I do like that.
Um.
Yeah,
occasionally I'll see that one.
Let's see.
I watch CHEERS sometimes. And, mostly just movies, when there's a good movie on.
Do you?
Uh-huh.
Actually when there isn't a good movie on, too.
Oh.
I just like to have the T V on if, you know, if I'm home alone or something
Oh, uh-huh.
have,
either the radio or the T V got to be on the whole time.
Yeah,
uh, oh, I do,
I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately.
Oh, really.
I've, well, I've been home with a, um,
I have a baby,
and and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much,
Uh-huh.
and so I'll, I'll watch a soap occasionally.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Do you watch any of those?
I, well, I don't, because I work all day.
Uh-huh.
But, um, I
I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days, like, you know, around Christmas or whatever,
after a while I'll start watching it
Uh-huh.
and then on,
for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened
Oh
and then I'll just forget it.
what, what ones do you get into?
Uh, I don't even remember
the last time I watched was back in college.
It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something
Oh, uh-huh.
and I maybe watched it for a week
Oh.
but, um, I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the, you know,
they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera.
How funny,
oh, yeah.
It was a,
Oh, I don't get into them that much.
When I'm home, sometimes in the day I'll I'll watch them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but, yeah, oh, I was really trying to think.
I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else.
Well, you said you have kids.
How old?
Oh, I have a six year old,
and I have a, um,
he'll be a year old in January.
So, you're, you aren't a SESAME STREET fan?
Well, they do, they watch it.
My six year old's kind of,
he's outgrown that one a little bit,
but but, I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby,
Uh-huh.
and he's kind of, he's entertained by it.
Uh-huh.
So, yes,
I, I do watch that one.
Supposed to be a great babysitter
Yeah,
well, they're not entertained for too long with it.
He's, he's still too little,
but yeah,
Yeah.
I do turn that on.
Um.
And I, I do like, um, DONAHUE.
Uh-huh.
Sometimes I watch that.
I think he has some interesting things on it.
I know,
what time is that on, *listen; strange ? placement
I never see it?
Um, that's on at, let's see, it's on at four.
Oh, okay.
I'm not home then,
that's why I don't see it.
Yeah,
I'll watch that occasionally.
He's got some real,
I don't know,
there's some real weird people that, he seems to come up with.
Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange
Yes.
Yeah,
oh, yeah.
. He does have some real bizarre things, I think.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, other than that, I don't know.
What's that?
Guess I'm not much of a T V person really.
Yeah,
well, I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us,
but Well, tell me,
is it snowing up there?
Um, no.
No.
It snowed a little bit, um, probably about four days ago
Uh-huh.
and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas.
Yeah
Oh.
there is snow on the ground.
Well, that's nice.
I, I wish it would snow a little bit more.
I've heard it's raining there.
Oh, gosh,
we've broken all sorts of records.
Oh really.
They've got,
I mean, we still have some highways closed,
and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago.
Oh, my goodness.
But, um, oh, just phenomenal,
I mean, I, you know,
you see it on the news all the time,
but until you've really seen it, it it doesn't really hit you.
Yeah.
But I was driving home from work Friday,
and I saw, there were some stop signs, I mean, submerged up to the writing on the stop sign,
and that was just
Oh, goodness.
it was amazing to me.
Oh, gee
so.
So.
So there has been some flooding
and,
Oh, there's been a lot,
yeah.
It's, it's too bad
but you know, the thing is that this happens,
in the last three years it's happened at least once a year, if not twice. But the people continue to move back in the flood zones.
Uh-huh.
Oh, gee.
So, I don't know.
I mean, you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for.
Yeah.
I don't think I would.
Oh, boy.
Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood.
Yeah,
oh, what a mess.
Yeah.
Well, now, do you work for T I?
Yeah,
I do,
yeah.
oh, uh-huh.
Huh. Well, this has been an interesting thing to do.
Have you made a lot of calls
or,
Um, I've, I've probably talked maybe to five people.
Uh-huh.
My husband is doing it too,
and he's talked to a few more than me,
Oh.
and, but it's been real interesting and kind of fun.
Do you get paid for these?
Um, five dollars.
Five dollars a call?
Uh-huh.
Gosh,
I wish I could do that
Uh, don't you have to do it as part of its,
We can't get paid for it.
Don't you have to do it,
What vacations have you been on that you like?
Um, well I really enjoyed, um,
I went to Mackinaw Island a few years back.
Right.
It's in the middle of Michigan
and so that was nice.
Uh-huh.
I like, um, driving to different cities because of the scenery,
so that was nice.
So you,
most of yours is kind of driving
and,
Yeah,
we've, I've been all over the states except for pretty much east.
Um, it's very pretty driving like, um, up north in Wisconsin too.
Um, how, how far do you usually end, end up driving just,
Um, the furthest I drove was probably Texas,
and then I've taken a train before to California.
Now where, you're from where? *slash error Oh, Wisconsin.
Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Yeah,
I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin.
Oh.
So, yeah,
that's quite a ways.
Yeah,
it is
I've, uh,
we went to California this last year and, uh, liked it,
Uh-huh.
but it was too crowded
Um.
Walt Disney World, and other places, it's just the wrong time of the year to go.
Oh, yeah.
And, uh, course, uh, you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's, uh, outrageously priced,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, kind of,
you wonder if they're, it's really worth it to pay, uh, thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in.
Yeah
But, There's lots of fun places to see. Um,
that's true.
I think the scenery kind of,
that's something do to, you like to get up in mountains *two utts
or,
Oh, yeah,
uh-huh.
Do you have any mountains nearby?
No
Pretty flat, isn't it?
Yeah,
yeah.
Um, I think, uh, the biggest limitation is a lot, just time and money, isn't it.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
What vacation have you enjoyed the most?
Uh, um. Probably, uh, when we go to Wisconsin .
Um, it's pretty fun.
There's a lot to do up there.
It's pretty busy, though,
you have to like crowds, you know.
What is it?
Um, oh, it's a, like a huge amusement park um, they have water slides
Okay.
Uh-huh.
and it's just a big, big tourist attraction.
The downtown is all like little shops and candy shops
and, it's, it's really neat.
I don't think, uh, hardly anybody lives there,
because it's just kind of like, you know, tourists.
Probably a city in itself, kind of like, huh?
Yeah,
it's mostly a, a summer, summer place.
Summer place.
How far away is it?
Um, from Kenosha, it's about three hours.
Huh.
It's about a hour away from Madison.
Okay,
sure.
Yeah,
so that's nice.
Sure.
It's, it's a pretty ride up there, too.
I really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin.
It's really pretty.
It's nice out there.
Oh, I like all the nature things there are to look at, you know.
Right,
well, and you can probably,
you're in a climate that's kind of humid,
so you have probably a lot of green, and lot of real pretty things.
Our, our climate's real dry
Where is that?
and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery.
Most of, most, most of the land's pretty brown.
You don't have as much of the greenery like you have.
Oh,
where's that?
Uh, Idaho, is where I live,
and, uh
Yes.
Okay
It's by, uh,
I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I'm on the phone.
It's by, um, Boise.
You ever heard of Boise?
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
And, uh, it's fine,
it's nice.
It's, uh, lot different kind of.
I lived in Indiana for a while,
and it's a real different, uh, land and scenery than there.
It's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity, and things like that.
Yeah.
I think, uh, there's a lot of places uh, oh, down, even in southern Utah, the canyons, canyon lands and Bryce Canyon
and, oh, boy, they're gorgeous
yeah.
Those are kind of fun places.
We usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer, which is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah,
and the lake goes on forever,
and that's real pretty over there too.
Oh.
But I think I'm kind of a summer vacationer.
Oh, yeah,
me too, uh,
me too.
Unless I'm going somewhere warm for the winter
Right.
Right.
Yeah,
that'd be nice.
Where'd you,
Uh, are you presently looking, uh, for a used car?
Well, as a matter of fact, I just bought one
Just bought one.
Just, just within the last three weeks.
what did you get?
I got a Lexus L S four hundred. Which is made by Toyota.
Lexus.
Uh,
Okay,
Lexus is a Toyota subbrand.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's kind of their,
I was wondering where that came from
because they're talking like it was an American built car.
Right,
it, it sounds like it, but it really isn't
Yeah.
It's, uh, marketed, of course, it its own dealerships.
Yeah.
Usually, or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership, uh
Yeah.
sometimes they do that,
but it's, uh, a brand car,
Yeah.
but I've really liked it.
It, it drives just wonderfully
and there is,
it's so quiet, almost can't tell the engine is running.
That's their big selling point, uh, other than general luxury
and, but the particular seems to be the, uh, the quiet ride.
It really is.
It's got pretty good acceleration, too.
Yeah.
It's got a C D player in it,
so I can, I can play those
and,
Uh, was,
that wasn't a standard, feature, was it?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
But there is not very many options on that car.
Uh,
There is only about five or six options.
Everything else is standard.
Yeah,
you get the impression that,
Uh, some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north. The C D and the premium sound system.
Uh-huh.
Skidding control,
you mean the antilock brake system?
Yeah,
it's kind of a traction control, I think they call it.
Yeah.
It's, it's not just antilock brake.
I think that's already on most of them,
but there is a further traction control, uh,
Oh,
this is a, uh, Uh, probably suspension tied into the brakes.
Yeah.
And, and also the suspension can be raised for driving, like in the ice and snow.
It can raise the car's center up a little bit. For going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere.
Um.
Yeah.
Yeah,
uh, shoot
Mississippi probably doesn't, Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much
some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.
No,
snow doesn't happen very often.
If it does, people go, what's this stuff.
Yeah,
uh, originally I'm from West Virginia.
We got a  pretty fair amount of snow.
Oh,
well, you had some there.
Yeah.
But, uh, I got down here in June of eighty-four,
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years,
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men into playful little children.
Oh, I know.
We had this group of, uh, surveyors come into, uh, a shop I was working in, uh, four or five of them, these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place.
They had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked.
But, while they were there they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place, had themselves a ball for about an hour
Oh, no.
Well, the, uh, the Lexus, uh, really,
and the moon roof I think is also an option.
Yeah.
Although most of them are ordered them with it,
but there really is only about a half a dozen, uh, things
and everything else is pretty standard.
Yeah.
I did not get the traction control which also, when you take the traction control and the and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats, too.
Oh,
so that's kind of,
You go out and get in that real cold car
It's a package deal.
and you turn that on,
and it, yeah, and it kind of, uh,
but that's only available if, with the traction control and the other option.
Yeah.
And those two are sold together
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to to, uh, do it,
Ouch.
so I, I opted not for that
but, And, uh, the dealership I dealt with, they order them all with the, uh, moon roof and, uh you know, nice floor mats and everything in there.
No,
it doesn't sound real necessary in Texas.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I worked for Lincoln,
So the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system
Yep.
Well, the, you know, nursery men will will sell you things here.
And they are, they are kind of in a labor of love.
The other thing to do if you, really like the hyacinths, and I do, is that before you plant those bulbs, stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them.
Yeah.
That is what I did with my plants.
I had bought these, uh, colossians Celosias or whatever.
Yep.
And they will not grow down here.
Huh-uh.
Okay.
Perennial.
Uh-huh.
Blue.
Salvia.
Salvia.
Uh-huh.
And now that will bloom all Summer long
and it will, it, but it insists on full sun.
Okay,
I bought me, oh, I guess, I just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little buds, planted, uh, already grown.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it looks pretty good out there.
I will tell you another plant that is purply
Uh-huh.
it, it is dark purply, kind of a purply blue red.
Uh-huh.
It is really a pretty plant.
It is sold down here as Purple Buddy.
Purple Buddy?
Now, it's not,
yeah,
it is not a perennial,
it is an annual.
But it will take the heat down here.
Purple Buddy.
Purple Buddy.
Its proper name is Gomphrena.
How do you spell that?
G o m p h r e n a.
Gomphrena.
And is sold as Purple Buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower.
Okay.
And they make, uh, oh, about a foot high plant.
And they send out this, this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it.
But that purple ball,
Well, Wayne, I, uh, feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children, and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available.
How do you feel about it?
Well, yeah,
I feel much the same way.
I've, uh, two kids right now
Yeah.
one is two and a half
and one's nine months,
and, uh, that age, of course, everything you do they're trying to learn to do,
and so, uh, it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn, you know, that, that they need to learn at the age, you know reading, and, uh, reading and playing nice with others, and that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we went through this with our children, and now with our grandchildren,
and I've always tried to do things with them, uh, like, when you're at the little league, helping out even though I'm not a good athlete myself,
I was able to help the coach in, in just controlling the kids, if nothing else,
and we've always, uh, oh tried to take our children and now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to.
I think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things.
Right,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
And so, it's uh,
we have, uh, lived several places around the U S
and we have, where we've lived, we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area,
like when we lived in Tennessee, we, we took them to Washington, D C to see all the capitol and, and things like that when they were small.
And it's just, uh, it's helps, I think, the children to, when they're learning in school, to say, well, I've been there and I've seen that.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
So, uh, that's the type,
Yeah,
it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,
because I remember our family, well, we, we, we went everywhere.
And, uh, seeing New England and, uh, being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was really made the whole thing more, uh, visual.
Yeah.
Yes.
And we could, uh, read the things in the history books and understand what they said, when it was like, we need food, we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we've, uh, gone through that, uh,
I remember my parents didn't do all those type things,
and so I made a special effort with my children to do things like that.
And even now with my grandchildren, I feel it's a very important thing to be done.
Right,
because if, uh, kids don't look up to you, or, or, can't feel they can spend time with you, they're going to find someone else
Yeah.
and uh, you know, nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to, emulating or whatever.
Yeah.
Well, I can remember one of the things I'm most proud of is, uh, when my son was,
I think it was in the sixth grade,
they had to write a, a little brief autobiography of themselves, and about what they had done and what they wanted to do,
and I was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to, uh, have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him.
A real point of pride with me.
Yeah,
that is nice.
Yeah
excuse me, it sounds like we both have colds.
Yeah,
well, it's, um, well, it's, uh, ten o'clock here in Falls Church, Virginia.
Oh.
So that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold
Oh, well, we're
And the wife says, Well, you need something to do,
talk to a guy on the phone.
Yeah,
well, I'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas, Texas.
So, we're kind of far apart here.
Yeah
This is a very interesting program I, I heard about here on this,
and when I signed up for it, it, uh, looked like it could be, make a real contribution in participating.
Right.
Yeah,
I'm an electrical engineer by trade uh, here in Virginia.
Yeah.
Likewise, we, uh, we do some projects every now and then.
We like to get support from, uh, other, other companies as well.
Yeah.
I'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan
So, Trying to work myself out of a job
But, it's been an interesting, uh, roughly, oh, nine months here,
and, uh again, this is our home area.
Oh.
We've lived here about seventeen years,
and it's, uh,
we enjoy living here.
It's where we originally started out,
and we've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee.
So, wound up back about two hundred miles aware, away from where we started out.
Yep
Well, uh, that's about all I can think to talk about right now.
It's been a pleasure talking with you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Right.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
All right
so, uh, you live in Dallas?
Yes,
I live in Dallas.
Now I understand that, um, the, the real estate market out there has really gone crazy, up and down, up and down.
Yeah,
I think right now it's, it's kind of bad Uh,
I don't live in a house,
I live in an apartment
Oh.
Are, are you in a house?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Okay.
Yeah,
we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington.
Uh-huh.
Well, I guess the best I can do is, is, uh, compare apartments
If it can compare the one that I have now, with the one that I had the last time, the one that I have now, uh, has a lot more amenities, I guess is the right word, than the one that I moved out of.
Uh, this one, you know, gave us free cable and, uh, ceiling fans
and, uh, it was practically new when I moved in here
and the carpet was new
and,
Huh.
Do you live in the high-rise?
No,
it's not a high-rise.
It's just a, a two story building.
Uh-huh.
Uh, but there's, you know, there, there are a lot of buildings
but it's just two stories.
Uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio.
On the first floor, um, where I am, there's a patio.
Oh, okay.
So, so you just, you have one floor all to yourself?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
The rooms are nice and large
and, let's see, I have, I have two bedrooms.
And, uh, ,
Oh, that's nice.
Do you get your own washer, dryer?
Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area
and I, I did buy the washer and dryer,
but they didn't provide it.
Oh.
The one that I moved from didn't, didn't have a place to put them,
and that's one of the reasons that I did move.
Yeah.
That is nice.
Yeah.
Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat
Yeah.
So, tell me
Yeah,
I've always, uh, been pretty lucky.
The real estate out here's been pretty good.
It, uh, the, the prices of, well, the prices came down last year.
We've, we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome
Yeah.
The past, uh, uh, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia.
Uh-huh.
It just , It's a real good ,
It just never happened before.
So it's really surprising everybody.
All the developers don't know what to do
Yeah,
it's a good time to buy, if you're in the market.
Yeah,
we're, uh, we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids
Uh-huh.
and we have a three bedroom house.
And it's pretty much filled up right now.
Oh, so you want a bigger one.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Get an extra bedroom or a basement.
Right now it's just a, a single level rambler.
Uh-huh.
One thing about the houses in, uh, in Dallas, they don't, uh, utilize basements the way they did in New York.
My parents in New York had, uh, a, uh, three family house.
Uh-huh.
Actual a,
two family house where the, the, um, the downstairs and the second floor they had,
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, you know.
Oh.
And, uh, they had a basement,
and they, you know, they finished the basement,
and they were able to rent that out also.
But, uh, in Dallas I, I just, I just haven't seen basements in houses.
Yeah,
yeah.
And I've looked at a lot of them, you know .
Yeah,
a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there,
and that's what he said was that, you know, it just wasn't something that people had down there.
No,
it's
They put pools and garages on, but, uh, no basements
Right.
I haven't, I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house.
Huh.
And, uh,
Maybe it's all the sand.
Is there a lot of sand in,
I always think it's like a desert,
I don't know.
Dallas always,
Well, no.
No,
no,
no,
you know, I don't see that kind of sand here. Um,
there are some areas though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh,
Uh-huh.
or the foundation is sinking or something. You know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.
But you, you have to know the right spot, to, to pick where that doesn't happen.
Yeah.
And, uh ,
Well, out here we, um, we live in what used to be, uh, like a prairie or whatever a natural, you know, natural grasslands.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they,
it's just, you go down four inches
and you get to well, fourteen inches you get to sandstone.
Yeah.
And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast
I see.
It's just solid sandstone.
Huh.
Where did you say you're at, Colorado?
No,
Virginia.
Virginia,
Virginia.
That's right .
Yeah,
it's sort of unusual really.
Most of Virginia is clay.
Anywhere near, uh, Virginia Beach?
Oh, yeah,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
My, uh, my folks used to live there.
Back before I was born, they lived there.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Well, different areas in Dallas have different kind,
in, uh, in Texas I'll say
because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, in the, in the Dallas, you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't see that.
Yeah,
well, uh, Texas is a big state
so I imagine the, the type of houses and, uh, things like that are truly different from area to area
Yeah,
well,
But, uh, that's the same way out here
because, um, well, we, for example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington
Uh-huh.
and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive.
Yeah.
So, you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house inside the beltway.
That's why we came out here.
This is called the, the, the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from D C, twenty-five from the city.
Huh.
But, um, it's considered the country since it's, uh, you know, that far out.
Well ,
But, um, yeah,
we live out by Dulles Airport.
I see.
Yeah,
and, uh, that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here
and, you know, it's, it's still pretty rural.
Uh-huh.
Uh, not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore.
Land has gotten so expensive
they just can't afford to have low income housing like that.
So, is your house in an area by itself?
I mean,
No,
we're in a development.
it's not connected to another one?
There's, uh,
yeah,
there's another one half an acre away, or a quarter acre away rather.
Oh.
But it's not, they're not connected are they?
Oh, no.
Huh-uh.
You have to, uh, stay in one single family home.
I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up.
Yeah.
Uh, my folks, um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids
but, um, for the most part they, they always had, you know,
and Pennsylvania always had a single family home
and so, you know, as soon as we could we, we got a single family home,
Uh-huh.
and that's all I ever knew growing up,
Uh-huh.
so. I stayed in a townhouse for, uh, two years and then, uh, saved up enough money to, to get a,
Hello.
Hello
Hi, um,
this is Betty
and I'm in Richardson, Texas.
I'm Nola
and I'm in Plano.
Oh, okay,
well here we go
I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are, that did some stuff over in the Gulf. Um.
Yeah,
now, did you push one?
Yeah, uh,
Oh, okay.
no
I haven't pushed one yet.
I just,
Okay,
but, I think it's,
I just started doing this
so I don't know too much about it.
Okay,
we're just sort of getting acquainted here.
Oh, okay.
Um, you know, I, I just wanted to see if, you know, you had an opinion about this,
or, you know.
Uh-huh.
Um, so, if that's okay with you, then I'll just press one.
That will be fine.
Okay
Well, hi,
Hi.
Good morning. Um,
I think I mean, if, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the, the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are,
and I mean they think differently
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours.
And, and right now, I, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just,
well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there,
I think we should just leave them alone.
I really do. In, in a major way because they just, um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself.
Yeah.
And that's the way, the course that they should go,
I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,
but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.
The, the thing with Israel and Palestine, I believe that should be settled between them.
And also, um, you know, the other thing is their idea, or our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them.
I mean, I mean, I'm talking about the whole middle
and, and maybe this is too general,
but I just believe that, um, they do not look at democracy the same way we do.
They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live.
Yeah.
And, so, you know, trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just, you know,
I don't think that that's the way to go in this
and, um, you know, it, it. Oh, well, that's, that's a couple thoughts on it.
Yeah.
I, I guess, you know, I'd like you to maybe express something here.
Well I, I, I think overall that's right.
I think it's kind of sad though, that, for generations they've been taught to hate each other.
Yeah.
And that's, you know,
if,
somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way.
That's,
yeah.
You know, an, an, I, I think that, um,
true we do have completely different ways of looking at things, at a lot of things,
but, uh, at the same time, I think there are a lot of, there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do, as far as example
and, and, uh, I think some different things could come from what's happened, than what we expect.
Well,
well, yeah,
um, I, I guess we could be a catalyst for their change.
I, um,
the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there
and I don't think we'd be talking about this, you know, the Israeli situation, Palestinian situation, um, sort of came to a head, um, unless there had been a war.
I mean that was one thing, that came out of it, good or bad,
Yeah.
I, I don't judge any war as good or bad,
it's just a war.
Yeah.
And I don't see any winners or losers,
I just see dead bodies.
I'm sorry. You know,
but, um, I, I just think, you know, you're right
and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along.
It's not going to be that we're going to, uh, you know, sort of, tell them to go to their room
and that's going to solve the whole problem.
Yeah.
It's going to be them,
But, that's the type of thing they understand.
Yeah.
They don't understand any other way.
And, you know,
And so at that, at that, you have to work at their level, to an extent, too.
It's,
Yeah,
that, that's true too,
I, um.
They wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war.
Oh, well yeah,
they, they understand violence.
There was nothing else.
Yeah.
They love violent leaders, to, you know,
I mean look at, you know, the leader they had.
They, they just adored him, because he was so strict and cruel,
Yeah.
and, you know, for a while there he had them,
I can't figure out why they adored him.
Well it has a lot to do with their religion.
I got to say, that over there, um,
Yes,
yeah.
and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this,
because I, I've, you know, traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that
and one, one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life, um, is from that area of the country
and I mean he is just overly, he, he is abounding in kindness, let's say.
Yeah.
And his wife is so godly, I mean, every thought,
they have a totally different life than we have.
Huh.
You know, and when you add the, um, commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them.
Yeah.
And they have very basic life, um,
well it's just a very basic life
and they just really believe in Allah, or God, or whatever.
Uh-huh.
And it's, you know, everything is to the glory of Allah,
and, and, you know, and, it, it's almost like,
What's sad is that the leaders that have control are power,
Yeah,
well that's, see using that,
yeah.
yes,
and they abuse that.
And it's always been military
and it's always been,
and that's, that's always been the way of the world. Don't you think
Which I think that that's not the, the way the majority of the people over there really are.
Yeah.
So it's really hard, when you see the leaders, compared to the people.
But I think in a, in a way the war, uh, I think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing.
And there are a lot of people who are good people.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know, there's,
and I, I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying to get out of that situation.
Right
and surrendering,
that was,
Yeah.
And, and, the, you know,
it just really comes down to people are people, you know,
you have to have some compassion some humanness.
That's right.
Doesn't matter where the boundaries are. Um, you know,
there are political boundaries
and those are man made boundaries,
but, you know, for heaven sakes, that's something that's been going on for ages,
and I, I think so much of it is what you're taught.
Yeah,
that's true.
You know, they teach their children, uh, in such a way that,
Well, hi.
I guess, uh, I'll just start by saying that we entertain with, uh, a gourmet club here. Um, which means that we have like eight, eight people, four couples.
Uh-huh.
And most of the husbands,
this is really peculiar,
most of the husbands cook.
Great.
I mean, the wives during the day, you know, get, I guess, so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day.
Um, you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff,
but it was the guys that got together and did all this.
Oh, that's nice.
And, um, like my husband just, he really, really likes to cook in terms of, um, oh, barbecue,
and I mean all guys, I think, like to barbecue.
I think it's caveman,
Right,
right.
I'm telling you,
but, um, he really does cook
and it's a good thing because, you know, you can't, you can't knock that.
No.
But all these other guys do too,
and so we've gotten together
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals.
And it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do.
You,
How often do you meet?
Well, we try,
I mean, because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that.
It's like, you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well
Oh, yes,
yes.
Yeah.
So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids. Um,
Uh-huh.
then we would, we tried to do it every other month,
Yeah.
but lately it's just been once every six months
Oh.
Well, that's much more reasonable.
I was involved in a, a club like that for, um, that, you know, where we tried to really do gourmet, uh, meals.
Yeah.
And, uh, we, we were a little bit too frequent I think.
Oh.
I don't remember if we were once a month
or anyway it was, it was difficult.
By the time we went around it was, uh, four couples
so, uh, by the time we got around, uh, to each of us and it was time again, we were almost tired, you know. Um, partly because, um, gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining.
Really,
really
It's too rich.
Oh, it is absolutely.
And, so, we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day.
Yeah
Um, so, uh, we, we kind of,
and then one of the couples, uh, moved
and so we sort of didn't, didn't continue it,
but, um, and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time, then you, you don't have as much time for, uh, regular entertaining,
but, um, uh, uh, when, when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be, um, kind of good for everybody
and that's, that sometimes means you can't do gourmet, because depending on who your guests are.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Well, yeah,
that's true.
And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish
so I mean he can get within,
Oh, yeah,
well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all.
Oh, my.
Uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, well, I take that back.
Uh, she can't eat some cream cheese.
But that, that really limits,
It sure
um,
it makes you, uh, keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out, for something like,
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Right.
So we, we try to keep all that in mind,
but otherwise, um, I guess, you know, entertaining, um,
I, I guess I have recipes
I, um,
but that's, that's basically what we do is the gourmet,
Uh-huh.
so, you know, they would be pretty elaborate.
Yeah.
Um, but it's fun.
I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff,
Oh, wow.
and, you know, you get all prepared
Yeah.
but you're right.
It's very, very rich
and I'm glad we don't have it every,
because it is, it's a, quite a treat
it really is.
Yeah.
Um,
Sounds wonderful.
Right,
but so, you like food
and I just love the, the community of food.
I just, think it's neat.
Oh, sure I do too.
Yeah.
I just love sharing meals and, and whatever you can do, you know, to do that.
Right.
I don't think you have to be, you know, more than hamburgers and hot dogs out, in the backyard and the, and the coleslaw and potato salad.
Right.
Right.
But, but,
Sure.
Well, my, um, daughter is graduating, uh, Sunday
and so we're having, a, uh, few people in Sunday afternoon.
Oh.
And I did a cop out on to it
I'm buying cold cuts
Well, I have to, make a cake
What are you providing ?
and I have to make hors d'oeuvres
and I have to make dessert
so, I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches.
Right.
Right.
There you go.
Uh, so, oh, I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on.
But I can't do it, you know, working full-time
and, it's just too much.
I know.
We're all not built like, uh, what, what, oh, Martha Stewart, you know.
Those people that try to do everything.
Yeah
We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and, and time to, you know,
Ugh
Wouldn't that be nice?
Yeah.
Shot a video of the whole thing,
I don't know .
Yeah,
right.
But it's, it's really kind of a neat thing.
I get a kick out of it.
I, I really do.
Everything, all parts of the food,
I mean I love to make things from scratch, you know. Making breads
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and, and you know people really pretty much appreciate it.
Oh, they do.
it's very difficult to purchase, um, items that are as good as what you can make yourself.
Oh, I think so.
Um, in spite of, uh,
or if you, if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive.
In fact, uh, I just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts
and I, I bought turkey and pastrami and, and barbecued ham at a, an Amish market near here.
Oh.
And I've never been there before. And found that there's, uh, individual vendors
Oh.
and the foods are wonderful.
And one of the, uh, the, um, vendors had cakes. All sorts of wonderful cakes. Uh, they, fresh strawberry cheesecake now and, and so on.
Oh.
And it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. Um, which is really not such a bad price.
I decided I, I just couldn't quite make myself, um, buy it because I do make cheesecake
and somehow I didn't want to do that because it,
There you go.
but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful,
and they had black forest cherry cake and all those things.
Oh.
That but those are homemade.
They are not, um, commercial bakery made.
And in that they are made in their homes, um,
so it, it's kind of interesting, uh,
it's out there if you want to pay the price
but,
Oh, it is.
I mean, we have bakeries around here that, you know, you, you just gain weight going by the door, you know, just like that.
Right,
just smelling the air
Yeah.
Right,
but I don't know
I guess some of the best things I've ever had, um, I, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know.
Uh-huh.
Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that, I have a kick making that, I mean, you know
Yeah.
I get off on strange little details of food, I guess.
But um, gee, we have so much going on here because you know this is Dallas,
Yeah.
this is the southwest,
this is, you know, chips and Picante sauce and anything hot.
Uh-huh.
You know you can always make it hotter, and, and lots of stuff like that, you know,
Right.
so. That's, um, a really good party time, eating all that hot food
Yeah.
and, and they just love it, you know, down here.
It just just, you know,
We like hot food too,
so.
all the stuff that goes with that,
so.
Right.
You don't sound like you're from Texas originally though.
Oh, I'm not.
Thank you for noticing
I'm from Chicago.
I thought, I thought, that there was a slight difference in accent.
And how I got,
Really
and how, I got to Texas by way, of Virginia I'm, and everything is a long story.
Right.
But,
I'll bet.
Yeah.
Did, um, do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy
or is it always
Well, absolutely.
I,
in fact, it just came to mind, um,
and this,
What was one of the latest ones that you've seen, actually?
Oh, I I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple weeks, months ago.
Uh.
Right.
The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home.
I've, uh,  uh, become available to come and go more often,
Uh-huh.
so I said "hey, it's worth it,
I'll just go at the matinee hour
and I can see what I please."
Yeah.
It's no more costly than renting one.
The last,
see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO
and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects,
kind of gory and lots of, you know action.
Uh-huh.
I have not done that one,
I don't know if I have even heard of that one.
Um, do you know that I don't follow performers,
Oh.
I don't follow actors.
Some I know,
Uh-huh.
some I don't.
Yeah.
Uh, and he was
the guy, the guy that played in it, he was not the star, but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in, uh, oh, the one about the old people.
COCOON?
COCOON,
uh-huh.
Okay.
He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON.
Oh, okay.
I don't, I don't know what his name is.
Uh, I think I know who you are talking about though.
Yeah.
At any rate, I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND.
That was with Richard Dreyfuss.
Okay.
And, that one was just a very poignant story,
it, it, it had people,
it was, it was you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny movie,
but it was,  a very, it was a poignant humor
Uh-huh.
and there was, it was like, uh, uh, STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
The characters played very well off one another.
Uh-huh.
And there was humor involved,
but the story was a very dramatic story,
and I enjoyed it very much.
What are some others that you have seen lately?
Oh, I'm trying to think, uh,
just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,  again
Oh, whoa,
yes.
and that's one that,
That's one I can watch,  over and over and over again.
Yeah.
I was going to read while it was on,
but then when it started, I just couldn't, you know, read.
That was a really good movie.
It sure was.
And, you know, the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it.
There are a number of good movies like that.
Yeah,
there's quite a few, uh, movies out now that I would like to go see.
My husband,  is not a real big movie goer,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go.
Yeah.
Plus, by the time you get a baby-sitter, and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive.
Uh-huh.
Right.
You don't work?
No,
I stay at home.
Okay.
Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day.
Yeah.
Go during the day,
that's right.
That's right.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Go in the early hours,
it's a matinee,
it's not crowded
and the price is as reasonable as renting a video.
Yeah.
And that's the way I do it
and I go quite frequently.
Uh-huh.
If you are going to be planning on doing that,
now I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, uh, witch hunt that is, you know, magically shot into the present time.
Uh-huh.
And, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very well persuaded to walk out. Very well persuaded,
there was more gore than I was interested in seeing.
Uh-huh.
But, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, uh, I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.
But,  uh, the action was comfortable
Yeah.
and, of course, I enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things.
So, I enjoyed that movie, after the first few minutes of gore.
And there were some others,
but they were done a little more tastefully.
Yeah.
But, uh, in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet
Uh.
and I could not handle that.
I said "whoa, I'm glad I have not had dinner".
Then, uh, I saw AWAKENING,
that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro.
I, uh, I, uh,
Robert De Niro?
Robert De Niro,
what did I say, Peter?
I think you said Peter.
I said Robert De Niro.
Yeah.
And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, uh, disabled person.
Uh-huh.
And, of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing.
Even when he's sad, you know, you great faith that he will get happy again.
Uh-huh.
And then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos.
I guess, I can wait another month
and they will be videos.
Yeah
One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
I've heard a lot about that one.
They say if you really want to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see.
And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television. Uh.
Well, you know, I think I read about that too.
Uh-huh.
And then THELMA AND LOUISE,
I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie.
It's about time for one of those.
I want to go see that.
Yeah.
And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Oh, you haven't,
I've heard that is wonderful.
Uh-huh,
I've heard it's wonderful too,
but I, it's just that they are both very long uh, movies,
Yeah.
and the matinee starts before I can get away from work.
Oh.
And, after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I've heard that's,
we, uh, we, uh, rented the other one,
I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately, uh, was PRESUMED INNOCENT, with, uh, Harrison Ford,
I guess he's in there.
Uh-huh.
And, I thought that was really good.
You know, I saw that
and I really I cannot remember too much about it.
It was the one where he was a defense,
uh, not defense,
he was a
Uh-huh.
And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the, the D A office.
Uh-huh.
And then he ended up being accused of it.
Oh, that's right,
I remember now.
Yeah,
I remember.
Yeah,
so, I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found out who it was
Uh-huh.
Well, I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies.
I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones.
I realize that he would like his career to develop,
but I don't want to see him in other things.
But, uh, I tell you, Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,
I, I never did care for him as, in the James Bond movies.
I don't know
he was too .
I was never into those movies, either.
Yeah,
I didn't care for the type of movie,
but he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed
and I didn't like him.
But, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.
Yeah,
I thought he looked real good with a beard, too.
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
he does
and there is just a, there's a,
I don't know, uh,
I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not.
Yeah.
And he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time.
And, I enjoy those,
and I enjoy some of the Michael J. Fox movies.
I didn't care too much for the last one either.
It just was not enough to it.
What was the last one?
I'm trying to think.
Uh.
Uh, the last,
like, BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one .
No,
no,
no,
it was called, uh, HARD WAY, where he was an actor, trying to portray trying to portray, portray a policeman.
Oh, okay,
And that,
Hi Ed.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, books,
I've, actually I am reading a couple of different books, uh,
one is, uh, a story,
well it is not a story,
it is a collection of, uh, of memos, supposedly written by Howard Hughes, uh,
Oh.
that was, uh, that was,
it came out a couple of years ago
and I have just now gotten around to reading it.
I have had it a couple years,
but, uh,
Who wrote that?
Oh, I do not remember the man's name,
he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two,
and he supposedly got this, this, story, uh, I mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell,
and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in Los Angeles.
Huh.
They, on
I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles,
they used to have a,
or, I guess they still do, uh,
had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices
and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected,
he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything,
he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away
and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for
he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, And had ended up,
I see.
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect,
and they, uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, uh, supposedly from, from Hughes to, uh, to his main, uh, main assistant back, uh, in the fifties and well, I guess, in the sixties, up until his death.
Well, that is interesting.
Right.
So, it's pretty interesting work
so,
That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
Yeah,
it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard
you have to plod through it
and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,
Uh-huh.
you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.
And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
No,
I have not seen it.
But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,
Yeah.
uh, I also reading, uh, the, uh,
it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have.
I am sort of rereading it.
It's, uh, a book about, uh, the Bermuda Triangle,
but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian,
he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, Bermuda Triangle. You know,
he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained,
Uh.
Explained , *listen; could be br
and, you know. Uh, and the reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, Well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen.
And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all
but it's, uh,
Flight Nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two,
and they were, they were lost
and, uh,
Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
Yeah,
they were.
Yeah.
And so, and in the book, you know, even,
he wrote this book back in the seventies,
and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water.
And, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth.
And, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
Yeah.
On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
Uh, no,
I have not.
I, I think that would be,
I am sure there is something out there, uh, ,
Yeah,
I would I would like to, too,
because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of of where she ,
I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
Uh
Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.
Yeah.
Of course, you know, it is so weird,
cause no one will ever really know,
it's, it,
so but it's entertaining
and it makes you think about things.
Right.
That is for sure.
Yeah.
So, that is pretty much for right now,
that is, what I have been reading.
Yeah.
I kind of like to read different stuff
and, uh, I like to read a novel every now and then,
but, uh, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.
Right.
Well, I, I guess I just have not read
I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,
Yeah.
and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's
and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.
Yes.
And I just really, really liked the way he writes.
It's just, incredible.
Yeah,
I read that, too.
I got it, uh, right, after it came out.
My, uh, you know,
Yeah.
he was an, an assistant district attorney in Chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book,
and, uh, my sister-in-law lives in Chicago,
and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this,
this guy is, you know, from here.
Uh.
And, uh, I read it and really liked it
and then about,
that is when it really got big.
And, uh, so I,
That was good, I think.
And, and the other book I am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year
and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY, uh,
OF THE VANITY ,
BON
yeah.
I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good.
Uh.
Yeah
I,
that was really, really good,
the movie was nothing compared to the book.
Yeah,
that is what I have heard.
And.
Yeah.
I saw the movie,
and, uh,
Oh, the movie was a joke compared to,
I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, uh, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
Yeah.
Right.
and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
Right.
I know.
And, anyway, we are not talking about that,
but, uh, gee, I just I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden
and, uh, And, uh,
Yeah.
I have a lot of, uh, uh, computer books that
I am, I do computer work
and so I have a lot of those.
So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but, looking through them.
Yeah.
But I, I'm interested in a lot of that,
but, uh, I have got a lot of books that I, I intend to read,
but I have not been able to yet, you know, for one reason or another.
Like, what is a book on your list,
you know I have a list too
and I have never gotten to it
Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list,
cause I just kind of, uh, I just have all the books out, you know,
I have book shelves
and I have them all out
and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh,
I have one now and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is
the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book
and, uh, uh,
Oh.
I have one
and I can not remember the name of it, uh,
it is supposed to be a mystery.
Okay.
Okay,
where have you all been on vacation recently?
Recently,
my most recent trip was last year,
and that was Detroit.
Detroit?
Yeah.
Is that a nice vacation spot?
Well, it wasn't really.
It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.
Right,
okay.
And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.
Right.
So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
No.
The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.
Ooh, that would be nice.
And that was real nice. Uh,
Did you scuba dive there?
No,
we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
Ooh, that would be nice.
Yeah,
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.
Oh, that would be enjoyable.
Right,
yeah,
that's, a nice break.
Huh.
I haven't been on vacation in a while either.
Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.
So it's a lot of fun.
I worked up there last summer,
so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long
Oh, well, that's nice.
Yeah.
Worked at a camp there,
and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.
So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.
Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,
and that's canoeing.
Oh.
And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River,
and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado,
and they've really enjoyed it.
That's nice.
We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.
It's a whole new,
Uh-huh.
And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.
Huh.
It's really, really pretty.
I was a little kid then,
and we to have, uh,
we stayed at some park
and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,
and he would give a little talk about mountain things.
You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man,
but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
Sure.
Uh-huh.
and we would have to, we'd
and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found
and, That's a good family place to go,
Oh, that's neat.
Sure.
and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,
but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.
Uh-huh.
It was like,
Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,
and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,
That's true.
and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do
Uh-huh.
Right.
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
Yeah.
And you're more receptive.
Well, that's good.
Well, we, um, let's see,
the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.
Uh-huh.
And then I went to England a few years ago.
Oh, that's exciting.
I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place
and it's, there's not a language barrier
so you don't,
I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,
but it's, it was really fun.
I, I, I really enjoyed that.
I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.
Uh-huh.
Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now,
but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England,
because she really has a great desire to do that,
because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
It, it's really nice.
I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,
Uh-huh.
and that's it was really different being in a big city,
because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,
but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,
Do your own thing.
Yeah.
I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
Uh-huh.
And I had a great time doing that.
It was really interesting.
That's wonderful.
There's a lot out there to see,
Yeah,
I know,
I'll say .
I keep wanting to get up to,
I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States.
I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,
Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada
Oh.
So that was, that, that's a nice place.
Canada is very nice.
Yeah,
that would be nice.
I had a friend from there.
Uh-huh.
Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia,
but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
Oh, yes,
absolutely.
Sure,
somebody that knows their way around.
So, yeah,
that's why, that's why England was nice.
Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week,
and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the,
most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,
Well, you've been quite a few places there
Yeah,
we have.
We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.
Once you think about it, huh.
Uh-huh.
It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,
and you slept on the train at night.
Oh, that's great.
But there wasn't a,
it was strange,
it was kind of sad,
there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English
and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.
Uh-huh.
That's great.
So we were kind of pitiful.
We found one restaurant we were in and got seated,
and then no one knew English in there,
and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
Uh-huh
But it was,
What did you wind up with?
Oh, I had fondue.
That was easy to say
Oh, okay
Tried to get fondue and white wine,
and that was,
Uh, uh-huh.
we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.
There were some people at the next table who spoke English,
so we elicited their aid for a while
They kind of guided you.
and, they were very helpful
Uh-huh.
so, It was, it was a pleasant time.
Well, good.
I'd, I'd love to go back there.
There's just not time
There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.
Right.
That's
Yeah.
I guess that's what retirement is all about.
That and sleeping late
Yes.
I keep hoping for.
Uh-huh.
Well it was nice talking with you.
I understand that.
Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.
And have a good afternoon.
You do the same.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay, uh,
well do you, uh, keep a family budget
or do you have some,
No,
I don't use a family budget,
my father who is very old has kept one his entire life,
Uh-huh.
and I probably rebelled against it.
I probably should have kept one.
He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage.
Oh, interesting.
Yes,
well, uh, we sort of started doing it years and years ago
and my husband started graduate school, when we were first married,
and I sort of just got in the habit, I guess. And, you know, never have gotten out of it.
I cannot really say that it's a formal budget,
it's more just a, a pretty, uh, a fairly, uh, accurate, uh, recording of what I spend, and what I think I am going to have to spend.
Right.
And, uh,
I think it makes much more sense,
Yeah.
and I have recently, uh, gotten out of debt and everything
and I will probably start keeping a little better, track of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just, uh, spent whatever came in and, and, uh, never knew what came in and what went out. But, uh, just, you know, like, about like the government runs.
Right.
Yeah
Huh.
That sounds real similar.
So, I think it is probably better to have some sort of a, a, at least a record
but my dad was so precise, that, I mean, if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent.
Um.
And that was put over there
Oh, my,
yeah.
and, I mean, of course, he is from the depression,
and, uh, so, uh, you know, it's his life,
Yeah.
Sure.
but, uh, I would, I think it would be smart if somebody would keep, uh, some sort of a plan that works for them.
Yeah.
I think you are right, um, uh,
well it must have been sort of interesting to us
is to, uh, it's because, since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years, I guess, I can go back and look
and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years. Uh,
Yeah,
it is.
For instance,
I'm a historian,
and my father had kept them, I think, since nineteen twenty-seven
and, uh, but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to
My goodness.
I could not believe he did that,
but then, so, I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present,
Oh dear.
Yes.
but, to look, to have looked back into the twenties, thirties and forties, it would have been fantastic, to see that.
Oh yes.
But, uh,
Well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things not not long ago, I guess it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had.
And she came upon a, a budget book that she had back in the thirties. Uh, when they,
Uh-huh.
it was the late, well
I guess it would have been, I will take that back, it must have been in the forties, because they had been married, uh, probably fifteen years at the time.
And, it was just, uh, fascinating to see how little things cost,
I mean it was,  it was just almost laughable in some instances that, you know,
Oh.
of course, it's all relative, of course,
I know.
Right.
but, uh, never the less it was fun to see those figures next to, you know,
for a pair of shoes was like five dollars
and
I know,
well even in nineteen sixty-three,
I found a record that I had, uh, I travel in Europe a lot and I, what I had paid for hotels.
Um.
And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now.
Oh.
And I paid, uh, oh, between four and five dollars, in nineteen sixty.
Oh, isn't that, something.
And that's really crazy,
cause that's about thirty years ago.
Really.
Oh, that is, that is really, really something.
Oh. But, of course, it's just what the market will bear.
That's true.
If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten.
Yeah,
You know, ,
that's, that's right.
That's, that's just good old economics working.
Right,
right.
Well, uh, we have tried to, uh, instill some, some sense of, uh, of budgeting in our kids,
but our two children are just, uh, as, um, unlike as night and day.
And, our son could care less about a budget,
Uh-huh.
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely, that she almost, she almost, just sounds like your father,
I mean, she has everything planned so closely, that if, something goes wrong, it just throws her for a loop
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, then you never know how they will,
one,
they may flip flop when they, get to be, uh, older.
Yes.
Right,
yes.
The other one may be very careful,
Yes.
and she may marry somebody
and, of course, it would be good because, it you marry somebody a little loose, then she will have that stability of watching, uh.
Yeah.
You should have one in the, in the,  in the house.
I think that is true,
I, uh,
and,  I think that is probably what happened in our house
And I think,
because I think my husband was not quite as, uh, good at saving and so on before we got married
and I was, I was really diligent about that.
I was putting money aside and when, before I was married, you know, when I was working out of college
and, uh, that really paid off.
Yeah.
Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school, we were in, in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts.
And,
Yeah,
that's about the way it is here,
Yeah.
if it had not been for my wife, I would have probably been in debtor's prison, if we had one.
So but, what does you husband do now?
Uh, he is an engineer,
he is, uh, an electrical engineer. And, in fact, went through, uh, many years of graduate school and got his P H D
Oh.
so we, had a lot of lot of years of budgeting
Um.
Oh, yeah.
You have, to do it when, you are in school.
And, you know,
Yeah.
When you,
My wife is still in school getting her doctorate,
uh, yes.
and it, uh,
Well, I'm working, I'm working on my master's degree now,
and I have got,
so, in fact, this last year we had three,
both of the children were in college,
our son has a year left
and our daughter graduated this year
and I'm just about ready to finish my master's degree,
Um
so we have had, uh, once again, you know, some really, a real lean year for us.
Oh, I, I know.
We had three,  in college, plus my wife,
But, uh,
so that was four.
Yeah.
So we were both in the same,
Yeah,
yeah,
you know exactly what it, what it's like then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's, uh,
which you learn,
I guess you figure that that is an investment that is, uh, really a invaluable.
That is the best one.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
with education you can't,  take that away from you.
Yeah.
That is right,
so it's, it's one that you can live through.
And I, think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel. You know, that that it was worth it to save and to not have, uh, something and, uh, in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
Right.
Sure.
so uh, it really makes it easier
Yeah,
that's true.
but, uh, well, I have enjoyed talking with you, Jerry.
I have enjoyed talking with you, Kathy.
And, I, I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life, because that sounds really fascinating to me.
I am interested in that.
Well, if I had your address, I would send you,
I am also in the travel business,
I do tours
Oh.
and I can take some real great tours to Europe.
So, uh,  if you.
Oh, wow.
Well, my, my husband,  and I just went there last year,
um, actually we did not take a tour,
we, we were in England and, and, uh, went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and, did it on our own
Yeah.
but, uh, um, I,
that sounds interesting.
Is your business in Dallas then?
Yeah,
it's here in Dallas.
Okay.
In the Quorum.
So, I, I'm Jerry Hammond
and I'm out at Brookhaven College,
so you could just holler at me there.
Oh, you are kidding.
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall
All right,
what is your last name?
Kuenzer, K U E N Z E R,
and I'm,
K U E N,
Uh-huh,
Z E R.
And, I will be,  in the communications department teaching, uh, English One Oh One to,
Well good,
I will,
I have a couple of sections.
Oh, well I know Zack Miller real well.
Yes,
yeah,
that's the guy who hired me,
yes .
Well wonderful,
I will look you up in the fall then.
Fantastic.
Okay.
Well, it's been good it's been a good type conversation.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Well, uh, how do you view this whole subject?
Are you, uh, one who feels like you have, have benefited from the change in, in roles in women?
Or, or what do you think?
Oh, yeah
I,
yeah,
I think so.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
there's been a lot of changes.
I think there's still a lot to be made, though.
Yes,
oh, yes,
I think so.
Uh-huh.
Are you, uh, are you someone who works outside your home,
or have you,
Yeah,
yeah
I work for T I.
Oh, yes,
Uh-huh.
well, uh, have there been significant changes, uh, do you think in the employment place, especially, uh, say at T I.
Uh-huh.
Have, has anything in particular changed that you have noticed? During your time there.
Uh,
Uh, I guess there's more women in, uh, what would be classified as a man's job
Yeah,
uh-huh.
What, what kind of work do you do?
I am a drafter.
Uh-huh.
I am in a man's job
Right.
But we have got more women in it now.
Yes,
yes.
There's a lot of us in it.
Yes, uh,
So.
yes
in years past, I know, in fact, even, even the word drafter has changed,
Uh.
because, it used to be they were draftsman
Uh-huh,
we have some engineers that still, on their, uh,
the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman.
Right.
And I want to scratch it out and put drafter
But I thought, well I am,  not going to do that
Maybe not, huh.
Well, uh, I, when I was in college,
I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four.
Uh-huh.
And I was a math major, which was a real rarity, among women at that time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I was in a lot of classes where, uh, there, I was either the only girl or, you know, one of just a very, few women in the class.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So, that was a change
and, uh, even, uh , I did not, uh, use my math, uh, in my work,
I, I became a technical writer.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing.
Yeah.
But, that has changed a lot.
Oh, yeah.
In recent years it has just really, really changed a lot.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, and I think that, uh, you know, the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management,
but I think they have got a long way to go
Oh, definitely,
definitely.
There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of, uh, chairmen of the board, chair persons, uh, if you if you will, of the board are women in this country.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And I thought that, you know, that's pretty a pretty significantly small number.
Yeah.
So, there are some, some strides to be made there.
Yeah,
yeah.
But, uh, I do not know,
I, I think we have come a long way, actually, when I think about, you know, when things were like even, when I, you know, just when I was in high school, and how it is now for girls.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
And, uh, uh, I guess my, I, uh, the one, my one bad thing is that I am, that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, I think she would have really, she would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that men, that women were not able to succeed, in her, generation.
yeah.
Do you,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
So, anyway. Do you have children?
No,
huh-uh.
I was going to say do you have daughters.
That's always a good question.
Do you?
Yes.
In fact, I have a daughter who is in a, a, who just graduated in civil engineering, from college.
Oh, wonderful.
So, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, you know, uh, one of the minorities, uh, females in the class.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So, she definitely entering into, uh, a male profession.
Oh, yeah.
But, uh, But, you know, for instance there are, there is the organization women, the Society of Women Engineers,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
so, that is recognized, as, uh, you know, a place where women should be.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But, uh, I do not know,
I, you see it in, uh, also in, uh, like in church, uh, where more and more women are becoming ministers. In, uh, you know, in protestant congregations
Oh, yeah.
and, uh, it will be interesting to see if, if Roman Catholicism ever, uh, recognizes women in, in the role of priest.
I I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or, you know, what you know about that.
No,
huh-uh.
Uh-huh.
I am not either,
but, uh, that is one area where it, that I can see might change, but I really doubt will change
Yeah,
yeah.
Not for a long time anyway.
No,
probably not.
Huh-uh.
So, uh, uh, how about, what in particular would you think that, uh, women still, other than the work place, where women still are being, uh, oh, you know, found wanting, you know, or not as highly regarded as men would be. Uh,
I was just trying to think.
Oh, I know something.
Uh-huh.
Maybe you could
what do you think that, what do you think, tell me what you think about this.
Uh-huh.
The, uh, the, uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war?
Oh, oh.
Because, I know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And the only, uh, branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force.
And, uh, I spoke because women were filing, flying missions into, you know, for whatever reason, into, uh, in the Persian Gulf war.
Huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
And so. But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job.
It was real interesting,
they were. I was listening to some of the comments on television the other day, uh, about it,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, one of, one of the men who was a,
I do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was, very high.
Uh-huh.
He said, it's just a personal thing with me.
I mean, I can not be real, you know I can not tell you why I feel this way,
but I just would rather have, uh, a man doing some of these jobs than a woman.
I thought, well, at least he was honest
But, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, I am sure
There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women
Yeah,
right
You know, Neil, well Neil as far as I am concerned, and I could be wrong about this, but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength, to do something.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh, because, I would think, I think, you know, mentally, uh, and emotionally, I think women can handle a job and, every bit as well.
Oh, I do too.
So anyway it's still words spoken while B is
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, you know, if she wanted to go to combat, I do not see that they should stop her.
Sure.
I personally would not want to go
but
No,
I would not either.
No,
I agree
but I am sure that there are women who would, would relish that, you know, kind of job.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
So, Uh, I guess that should be taken into consideration, as well.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, well, this is an interesting topic,
um, I have, you know, I have,
having a daughter who has gone into this, into engineering, I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh
She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and, a little more assertive, than I think I was
Good.
So, that's, that's progress, I guess
Yeah
Well, I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa,
and, Uh, have you talked with a lot of people in this project
Well, same here.
or,
Well, I am not a home, at home a lot.
Yeah.
I am at work right now.
Oh, yeah.
I put my work number,
but, at home, uh, the recorder gets my calls.
Oh, yeah.
Usually, I am not there,
Right,
but I probably talked to seven or eight people.
Yeah,
well, that's great,
Uh-huh.
that's good.
I personally have not made any calls yet, myself,
I, just, it never crosses my mind.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
But I enjoy receiving them.
Yeah,
well, that's good,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
that's good,
because, uh, I, I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls. And, uh, only because I going to make some money,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
see we, our choir is doing this as a money raising project.
Uh-huh.
We, we got the connection through a T I, uh, church member.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, uh, so we are doing it to raise money for, uh, a large project at church,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful Financially painful, anyway.
Yeah.
That's wonderful.
It's just real nice that way
so, uh, I thought, well I will just get on the stick and do it.
Yeah,
that's great.
Well, I will say good-bye to you,
Okay.
but I have enjoyed the conversation.
Well, thanks for calling.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Hi Pat.
Hi.
One of the interesting things that I have considered about the role change for women is that women of my age, my generation, were trained and taught and brought up to be the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER housewives.
Uh-huh.
But we are not living in that world.
We are certainly not,
our families have changed.
Uh-huh,
families,
uh-huh.
Society has changed.
Oh, yeah,
sure.
Everything has changed.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh-huh
That's one of the,
and it makes you really concerned.
I am glad I raised guys.
Uh-huh.
You know, let the world train them what to do
But characteristically, you know, the women are trained, or have been in the past trained in the home.
Uh-huh.
And I really would be at a loss to, to raise and train a girl.
I think I would.
Yeah,
it's,
well even, even raising boys today is different though, because, they are expected to do so much more than they used to.
Oh, sure.
Uh-huh.
You know, used to be they would just go off to work and come home,
and you know, everything was done.
And it, it's a different world.
It's, some good, some bad, uh,
Oh, sure.
Uh-huh.
it's nice that there's a choice.
I, I have chosen to stay at home, and raise my children.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And I have a ten year old and a twelve year old.
Uh-huh.
And I was a single parent for awhile and worked.
Uh-huh.
And that was great,
I was able to and I was able to provide for my children
and, and you know, that was wonderful.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But I, I thank God everyday now that I have that choice. And that I am able to do things at home
Sure.
and, and uh, I volunteer a whole lot.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, that's my job right now.
Uh-huh.
And I, I love it.
Oh, yeah.
I really love it.
I did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said Mom, please do not be involved.
Right,
right.
Then I went back to work.
Right,
and that will come.
Yeah.
I know that day will come,
Sure.
and I am looking forward to that too.
Right.
But that's a different phase in my life,
Right.
and I am, I am glad that I am able to do what I want to do right now.
Well, you know, there's a lot of things that have happened, actually,
and, and it's, it's like the, it's like oil on top of water,
it changes
but it's never different in a lot of ways.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, women at one time did very heavy physical labor and, were expected to maintain a household.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Then as times changed, uh, as it is today, we do not do a lot of physical labor, even in even in housekeeping, and homemaking,
Uh-huh.
Right,
Right.
there's not a lot of physical labor, because, there are,
Right.
You are not beating rugs,
Uh-huh.
you are not, right, doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing.
Right.
And in that respect, we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion,
Uh-huh.
or we really do develop some health problems.
Uh-huh.
So, in, in that, in that respect I am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit.
Yeah,
yeah.
And, uh,
But don't you think it's that way with men too?
I mean, you know, men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more, than they used to.
Oh, absolutely true
it's, that's true with society, in general,
Yeah,
yeah.
but specifically the woman's role, in society has changed.
Uh-huh.
And, you know, medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases.
Right,
right.
Heart disease was characteristic of men,
Right.
now there's almost equally predominant in women.
Right.
And I,
And stress disorders and things like that.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right,
and, I think that that's a, that's a symptom of our society,
it's a symptom that there's, there's a general illness that needs to be healed.
Uh-huh.
I do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem,
I am not, I am not God.
Yeah,
yeah.
But, I, I do know that in raising my boys, I really did meet a lot of pressures saying, you know, you need to get them into music lessons,
you need to get them, into sports
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
you need to get them into this,
they need to be busy
and they need to be active.
And I fought all of those things,
I said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me
and they will say Mom this is important to me,
I want to do it,
Right,
right.
otherwise, I will guard their ability to have quiet time.
You know, it's funny,
I refused to cram their lives full.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's funny,
it's funny
I was  I was really looking forward to summer, thinking oh, we are going to have some time off.
And that's the way it is with a woman too.
Uh-huh.
And it's been real busy.
And actually, today is really the first, as far as I am concerned, the first day of summer Because we have had so much going on the past few weeks.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, you are right,
Uh-huh.
uh, well that's how society has changed, uh, you know, uh,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
the family has changed,
we, you know, we find ourselves doing things that, we never did as kids.
Uh-huh.
You know, I do not remember, being involved in things like this.
Well,
Uh-huh.
It's, it's different,
Uh-huh.
it's just,
I do not know,
only time will tell whether it's better or worse, than the way we grew up.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, it's, it's just very different.
Of course.
Uh-huh.
Um,
Well, I just am very much a believer in quiet personal time.
If you do not have the time to talk to yourself, who are you going to talk to.
Right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And I guarded my children's rights for that
and I think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do.
Uh-huh.
They are sacrificing their time with themselves.
There's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored, if you thinking internally, and you are, working on your own self.
I mean, they really all look a like,
Yeah.
Yeah.
and the
I don't have any idea what, which car it is, until I look at it to see what it is,
What is what,
yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and I think they have not, uh, lead the field in styling,
they do have sports cars
Yeah.
but the price is way more,
you can get a Cadillac for, the same price as you can get a small Japanese, car,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
it's ridiculous now.
Yeah.
I know that, uh,
I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike you know,
Uh-huh.
I guess it just, uh, it seems to me they're all the same shape.
I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal
and she, she's had, she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it
and that's what she's going to buy again
and I'm like, oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got
and, so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
well, if, if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show.
I, I look at the Cadillacs
and boy there were some Cadillacs that I didn't even realize they made
but they were, just styled so differently,
Really.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
they were standard Cadillacs
but they really looked beautiful.
Are they still,
are what they're,
what they have out for like the next year, is everything still pretty square,
it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really, I, I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance .
Oh, no,
they have, they have convertibles now in the Cadillac, field
Yeah.
and they have that new, uh,
it's not the big, uh, Fleetwood, the one I want, which is been the same in the last twenty years,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
there's another one that has came out in the last two year, not the Seville,
the Seville is totally different,
Uh-huh.
now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars.
Now when, when was this,
was this recently?
Oh, yeah,
it was a month or so ago.
Oh, okay,
because I have,
Well, they have it every year.
Yeah,
usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair
and that's usually when I see anything, you know.
Right,
now this was, uh, in it was downtown in the, uh, Convention Center
and, they had all the cars
Oh, I see.
they had Japanese and German cars,
Yeah.
they had the full range ,
and they had some, they had some new cars that weren't even out
they had, uh, a new Chevy Suburban, truck, you know,
Oh, really.
that big, big one that was, uh,
they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost,
Uh-huh.
it had a microwave in it and everything,
Oh, my word.
it was,
they had several futuristic cars.
That's wild, you know,
Yeah.
you hear about things like that
and you think that can't possibly be done,
I mean, it just, that's just too weird.
I know.
And I like engines
they had a lot of broken down not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, uh, displayed engines, you know.
Uh-huh.
Right,
uh-huh,
so you could tell,
see the inside of them or whatever.
Yeah,
Yeah.
but, uh, that, that sold me in buying a new car, you know,
I mean, certainly interested in buying a new car
but again the, yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and, new engines,
Yeah,
yeah,
well, maybe,
and, uh, I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while * spelling "think"?
somebody's finally woken up, you know.
and, I think that, I, I would definitely buy,
Yeah.
again there's the question are we in the market, uh,
Yeah.
and I could buy anything, you know.
Oh, yeah,
you know, if I could fine, * spelling "find"?
I, I was really crazy about Jags for a while
and the convertible, had a is it X J S or something like that,
and I, you know, thought that's a dream car,
Yeah,
Yeah.
and, and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you know.
Well, I haven't work on them myself so I don't, that, you know, my cars don't go to the shop, you know,
Yeah,
so, uh,
yeah.
I am the kind of engineer
and I've always done it myself
and, uh I've got three of them
Well, that's good that you can.
and, uh, I can't remember one,
I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me, in a years time,
Oh, really,
that,
oh, gosh,
that's great.
I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just the welding on
like I said I don't do that you know.
I think it takes a talent to do that, you know,
my, my husband is, uh, engineer
but he cannot, I mean,
or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it
that's might be part of it,
but, uh, you know, we just, I just say forget it we'll just take it in, and get it taken care it.
Yeah.
He drives, drives a Honda.
I, I, noticed that when I was a kid, uh,
I was wasn't a mechanical engineer
but I worked my way through college as a mechanic
so,
Uh-huh,
I learned early from, fifteen on, and dropped it for a long time when, when after I got out of college and, then picked it up again later on
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and now again, I've got three vehicles
and I don't, I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you know.
Well, that's to, that's one thing that when you would consider,
see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, well, is this engine that I can work on or that, you know, my husband can work on or whatever, you know
Uh-huh.
so, you're, you're pretty lucky in that respect that,
Yeah,
I'm keeping V eight, V eight Chevy engines, because that's what I know,
Yeah.
That's when you know,
yeah.
and, in fact, I stock the same part,
I'm like a little stock,
if you, brought your Chevy to me I could, I'd probably have some parts, for it right now, you knows
Uh-huh.
That's pretty good,
it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car
and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything,
Oh, that's great,
and it's, it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, uh, my husband Carl has called all over the country, you know,
I've always wanted to that too.
he's gotten these catalogs
it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventy-three,
Oh, I can imagination,
Well, I guess, um, I'll start out,
and that is, um, I don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about, whether it's the first eight grades, the high school, or colleges.
I have mixed views on all three of them.
Uh-huh.
What do you think about, what do you think about the, the lower grades, you know, K through seven?
Well, I, I, I should imagine the lower grades,
what would, what, what's, what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that, uh, many of the inner city and, uh, I guess what we'd call, uh, ghetto or poorer districts, including rural districts, don't seem to be able to produce the students that, indeed many, uh, manufacturing and other, enterprises want.
Uh-huh.
Right.
They can't seem to, they can't seem to read properly, do math, properly, and conform to what employers want.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
I, uh,
So that's got everybody excited.
High schools, I'm not too sure.
It seems that high schools at least produce candidates, although I have great misgivings about the S A T that go on to a variety of colleges.
It seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them, uh, from, um, a myriad of nations,
and, uh, and also, um, uh, I think that, uh, a certain percentage of, uh, the colleges produce a fairly uh, public colleges produce a fairly decent student, or fairly decent graduate, I should say.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I, I, I just read some things recently where, um, uh, colleges now, uh, graduate programs in general now train, basically, they're fifty per cent foreign Uh,
Oh, I didn't realize it was that high.
Yeah,
oh, just about
yeah
but when you consider, um, when you consider, uh, especially in technical areas, science, engineering and computers.
Wow.
Yeah.
well that's what I was going to point out, I think it mostly is that technical,
Yeah,
especially in those areas, it's, um, I it's, it's almost fifty per cent foreign, like forty-eight per cent,
and that involves both Canadian, and, uh, uh, European, Middle Eastern, and, and Far Eastern,
Yeah.
yeah.
Wow.
I, I think, um, I think I have similar views,
that's, you know, where our elementary grades, um,
it's amazing,
I have a friend who's an who's an elementary school teacher,
Yeah.
and she said that they recently, you know, they have to go through, they have to, they have to pat the kids down, because they bring guns to school.
She teaches in the city, of Baltimore,
Yeah.
and that,
Yeah,
that,
yeah,
that must be an inner school.
I just read a, an, amazing article, I guess, in this month's this week's NEW YORKER about Baltimore, uh, which, uh, went on to talk about,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I don't know,
I thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor, or, or, or the politicians in the, in there,
I I do, I do know a few people and have been, have done some business up in Baltimore,
Uh-huh.
but it seemed to me that the inner school system there was the one thing that didn't the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well.
They talked about individual cases of people trying hard,
but it was very difficult.
Uh-huh.
I, I, I, I think, if I was going to fault it, now,
if I'm, I'm looking to carry on a conversation, that way, I there's a couple of things that really bother me,
Yeah.
I think when I learned the other day, uh, uh, that, uh, the average American, the average American, now, watches seven point two hours of television a day,
Uh-huh.
and that school children, are not far off that mark with six point eight.
Now, I don't know what school children, what year that is.
Right.
I mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube.
Yeah,
and it's, uh, uh, it's really,
you know, kids can't read, um,
Well, I,
it's really,
they,
you know by the time, they,
Yeah.
my wife teaches, uh, middle school.
Really?
Yeah,
and they can't,
Oh, so you're close to the subject.
yeah,
by the time they get there, they can't read.
they, they can't read anything.
And yet, you know I have grandchildren,
I have ten, uh, nine grandchildren in various parts of the country,
Uh-huh.
and, of course, you know, I can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools,
Yeah.
these kids go to a
they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood,
Yeah.
and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well.
Uh-huh.
I, I, I mean I quiz them
and I talk to them,
and they, they read well,
they do everything well.
But I, I, I mean, I think that's a that's part of the environment.
Yeah,
I think it's, it's probably the work that your, your children, your children are doing, uh, um
Yeah,
that, that, that, that could be very well true.
She, she's, yeah, she can tell, she can tell, you know, when they have kids come in for,
Yeah.
Right.
they meet with all of the parents,
Yes.
and she can tell before a parent comes in, normally, you know, give or take, eighty, ninety, per cent, you know, what the parents are going to be like when they come in, and the responses the parents will give back.
Really.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Oh, I, I, I,
Oh, yeah.
yeah,
I guess I could, I can understand that.
Uh-huh.
However, I'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago, uh, maybe not that long ago,
Yeah.
but,
and, um, and so, I, I always felt I didn't get a real good education in the in the grammar schools and part of high school,
Uh-huh.
so I lived in New England at the time,
I sent all my children to prep school.
I was
I I didn't have that much money
but we struggled
and we did it
Right.
and I thought it, I thought a great deal of it was, a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio.
I think, I think it's probably very true.
And, I, I, I think that could, that's a formula that could be applied everywhere, except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do, it in public school.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But you know, surprisingly, I, I, because you put such a commitment on education, um, your children probably could have gone to schools with, uh, uh, a higher student teacher ratio, and still done well, because when they would come home, you and your wife, would say, you know, what did you do today,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
if we, let's sit down and read together.
Well, that, that, that's, that, that must be, then, then if that's, uh,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I think we both agree on that, then, then, then, then a parent,  parental involvement has to be there.
Yeah,
oh, it's parental.
Yep.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
And I guess you got to take them away from the tube also.
Another thing that I have, another problem I have is, uh, I don't really know how to resolve this,
but is the, incredible, at least in the high school and college level, emphasis on sports, where enormous amounts of money are spent,
and it seems to me that money could be more well, well spent somewhere else.
But you you know what's really funny is that they, there's been some research, because I'm a, I'm a college professor, and, um, uh, and, and, a lot of the research shows that like, Georgetown, while Hewing was playing at Georgetown, basketball, Georgetown, and they were winning, endowment to the university, in other words, money that could to everything, everything, and normally gets directed away from sports, realistically, a lot of the, was, uh, was probably, two-thirds, I guess it's now two-thirds of what it was when they were national champions.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
In other words, while they're national champions, people donate more money.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right.
Average human beings like you and I, average Joes, that make a decent salary,  that are a graduate of the school, send big bucks, like couple hundreds of dollars,
but I mean,  uh, right.
but thousands of people,
To, to what, uh, to,
you say other things than sports, though.
Because, no,
normally it's because of the sports.
Yeah,
I know,
but I mean, they don't just send it to the new stadium,
or,
Right,
right,
but see, the sports brings in the money.
Really.
Because when Georgetown was number one,  their, their, their money that was donated to them from companies,  from, from from business people, from graduates, whatever, was up into, you know, like twenty million dollars,
I, well, I guess they're  Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
and now it's down to like, fourteen million.
During that time period, in other words,  their income has their, their alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then.
Well, I never thought of that benefit, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I, I never thought, of that benefit,
Uh-huh.
but the consequence, then,
Yeah.
I, my, I guess what I'd have to say about that, is, there can only be one champion
Yeah.
That's,
yeah.
It's, it's amazing the way,
but now that's big time.
Isn't that something, though,
Yeah.
I didn't realize that.
But, but, uh, smaller schools aren't like that, uh,
No.
only, only the big time schools show that.
Yeah.
But you're right,
I, I think the emphasis on sports,
and as a,
see, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a former athlete in a sense,
I swam, um,
Yeah,
yeah.
but swimming never gets much glory, so it really doesn't matter.
But,
Well, Mark Spitz made a lot of money on it.
That's true,
that's true,
but you know they still,
And he and he came back this year,
didn't he,
but he didn't make it.
He didn't make it,
no.
No.
I, I would have liked it if he, if he would have, though,
Yeah.
but I think, uh, realistically you know, you read the, the research studies,
Yeah.
and, uh, I don't think he would have made it simply because the the event he was trying to swim, they even, the research shows that distance running, so I would assume distance swimming might be similar, that,
Yeah.
and he was good at distance, Spitz, as a swimmer, you know,
at,
Well,
I can remember that,
but the distance, um, the, the distance strength and endurance, or whatever, sort of starts to peak at about twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
That's why some of your long distance runners, were in their early thirties,
Right.
Right,
right.
and, but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event,
Right.
and most of them, are under twenty-five.
Well, I read, I, I also read, I,
we're getting off the subject here a bit,
Uh-huh,
yeah.
but I, I do want to add this to that, because I, I was quite interested in that myself,
Uh-huh.
but I read where, the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay for the distance events,
and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors, if you brought just the
Oh, you're kidding.
here he comes down the finish line,
right?
So it had to be, it had to be, where they could put it in one segment,
Jeez.
and, and, and I guess, capture the whole thing for some sponsor.
Huh.
And that
Let me ask you another question.
as, as an athlete, I just hate that.
Go head,
Yeah.
yeah,
what were what were you saying?
Well, if you teach uh, college,
Yeah.
and, and, I know, when I went to college, I, I went to summer school,
Uh-huh.
and I thought that, uh, in fact that, my idea of it was, uh, rather than, rather than finish early, I just enjoyed some of the subjects that I was taking
and I had the ability to, to go in summer school,
and I, I did, take those subjects,
Uh-huh.
so what that leads me,
my next thought is, I understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway, compared to the Japanese, or the Germans.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Yeah.
I think, I think,  I think, uh, in, in some sense, um, what I would do before I would extend a school year, is I would make it better. Before I would continue the agony,
Well, how do you think that would work in grammar schools
and,
Yeah,
yeah,
that's right
and something you have to consider, too, um, because I know as a, as a, as a former high school teacher, I know that from right now,
Yeah.
Okay,
so.
Okay,
we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.
Right.
What what,
Okay
um, where do you work at
or do you, you wish to discuss that?
Uh.
No,
I, I'm in, uh, well
I live in, uh, Richardson,  Texas,
Oh, okay.
and, uh,
Yeah,
we're neighbors.
Yeah.
Okay
And, uh, but grew up in, uh, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work.
Hi to someone in
Uh, and uh,
Can you hang on just a minute?
Yeah.
Thank you to someone else in
I have no idea.
He didn't broadcast.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.
No.
Go ahead.
So, uh, uh, not, not growing up familiar with here, uh, uh, when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that
Oh, I do all the time.
I do all the time.
And, uh,
I get a lot of good tips from him.
Yeah.
Uh,
I have his book, too.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Don't do any, uh, any gardening in the sense of, uh, vegetable gardening
but, uh,  tried some, tried some different, flowers, and, and, uh, bushes and stuff, and, uh, uh, have a, have a lawn service.
Not in Texas.
There was one when, we, when we bought the house
and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one,
but in terms of the fertilizing and, uh, weed control, mainly leave that up to them.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Well, no,
I had a lawn service one year,
and I thought phooey, I'm going to do it myself because I figured up the cost
and I said, huh-uh
Yeah.
I can do it much cheaper and better.
Yeah.
And so what I did, I switched to liquid,
and I do it with an applicator with my hose,
and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over  the territory.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was surprised how easy it was.
Well like eating
And, I thought, well, I'm going to do this all the time.
Well, good.
So I found, you know,
and I've got some problems with, uh, two trees in my front yard,
and I took them to a certified, uh, nurseryman the other day,
Yeah.
and do you know what he told me I needed to do?
No.
Which is,
it's just unreal.
He said I needed to pull every leave off the tree,
and the tree is fifteen feet high,
and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it
and he told me I needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase.
And I thought, uh-huh, this is, this is unreal,
this is unreal.
Yeah.
So, uh, I think I'll get my son-in-law to do that for me, if he will.
Yeah
What, what, what kind of a,
is this some sort of a disease,
or is it a pest?
Yes,
it's a disease that it's got,
and I don't know, what happened to it, uh,
What,  Well, what kind  what kind of trees are they?
and then it  it, um
Well, one is a maple,
one is, um a maple,
Huh.
but I would much prefer,
I think it's not a native Texan tree.
Yeah.
And, uh, the one that, the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property,
and they don't, get any care,
Uh-huh.
and they're cedar elm,
and they're just beautiful.
Uh-huh
So I mean, it, it's, you know, these things that you pamper,
some people have really a green thumb,
and, you know, and, um, although I don't have too serious a problem,
Yeah.
but, I don't know if it was from the, the, the late freezes that were, or the early freezes we had, that caused this tree damage,
and you know, Sperry said, you know, that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles, the last two years that, you, we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I kind of think that maybe that, uh, happened to these large trees that I have.
Yeah.
And I really hate to lose them,
but, um, that's one of the hazards I guess of, uh, having a, a yard.
Yeah,
yeah.
Because I,
Well, that's, that's one thing that we we've had very poor luck with, with, is, in, in our yard is, is trees
Uh-huh.
but the, uh, what, what trees were, were there when we moved in, uh, uh, were, had been put in by the developer when he built the house,
and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree I think.
Right,
the quick growing,
yeah,
and they, and he,
And, uh, figured up last night, at,
there were seven different trees of, of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in,
and we got one left at this point,
but, uh, a couple of them we've lost to, the, weren't too good trees, we've lost to wind, uh, uh.
Uh, uh-huh
Three we, three we've lost to, to, uh, freezes between, uh, eighty-three and uh, and then, uh, a year ago we lost, uh, another one.
Can I pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees?
Did,
are they still there,
did you cut them down at the, at the ground level,
or did you pull them, up by the roots,
or how did you get rid of them?
Because if I
Well,
I, I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a circumference of about ten inches,
and,
Yeah,
we didn't we didn't have any that were that, that big when they, uh, went.
Oh.
two two of them, uh, the wind, the wind blew over uh, in, in terms of getting them down.
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh  the,
Because I don't want  stubs in my lawn.
Because   you still have to
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now the one that, the one that we lost, the last one that we lost a, a year ago  uh, up until then, they hadn't been big enough
Uh-huh.
but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, at,  as close,   close to ground level as I could, and then, uh, got  got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps  helps rot the,
The base?
To the ground?
Uh-huh.
Bore?
I see
uh, a stump killer.
stump yeah, stump killer, and stump, stump rotter,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, this last one had a fair sized root
and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood, uh,
and, and saw it and stopped in and asked, if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks,
and I said fine.
He had, he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that,
and it
Yeah,
and they get that saw,
and I think it's a, some kind of a a screwing thing that just rips it right out.
yeah,
and it, it just, it just ripped it right out,
Right out,
yeah.
and, uh, I took the,
it left the, it left, he left the chips,
and I put them up   mulch around, around the other shrubs, and, uh, uh, had, had a pile of dirt from various things, uh, back by the garage that I filled in with
Used those for, uh, mulch,
sure.
Sure.
and, and it's filling in with, with grass, uh, nicely this year, so that, that was, that was worth it
Uh-huh.
but, uh,
A blessing in disguise.
Yeah.
I mean, two fold purpose.
Yeah.
Yeah
but, uh,
Yeah,
well
do you do your own, uh,  lawn in terms of, uh, mowing?
Lawn?
Yes,
Uh-huh.
Yes,
I have a, I have a self-propelled, uh, Snapper.
Yeah.
Because I'm sitting on a hill,
and it, uh, and it's very difficult to address.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
I,
uh, yeah,
I, I, I, we just got a, a old push, uh, uh, Sears mower.
I, it's been fifteen years now, since we first moved to Texas, we've had it,
and I keep waiting for it to die,
but, every year it just seems to hang on,
and, uh, and, uh, I do it my, do it myself.
Well, that's good
They're very expensive.
But, uh, yeah,
a year, a year ago I took into, took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season
and they said, no, it's, it's too old,
we won't even work on it.
Oh, booey
yeah.
And I took it back home,
and it's,
can't,
kept,
plugs along.
But, uh,
Yeah,
they always try to give you a song and dance.
But, my son's, uh, one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have
Okay.
Hi.
Do you have lots of credit cards
Yeah,
we, well, we have quite a few
but we don't really use them a lot.
We have, well, we like a lot of gasoline credit cards, because we like to be able to stop, you know, when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station,
Uh-huh.
but as far as like MasterCard and Visa, we don't use those too often.
What about you?
Um, I used to have a ton of gas credit cards,
and now I have one or two of them,
but I think I've even let some of them expire.
But I was living out of the country for a while
so I wasn't using them too much
Uh-huh.
and I don't drive that much.
But I have, you know, MasterCard and Visa as you know,
I have a MasterCard and an American Express now.
I got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards.
Right.
But, as long as,
like my MasterCard is, um, free as long as you spend about, I don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that.
Uh-huh.
And so, I tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card, when I have the choice.
Yeah.
And, um, I used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff.
The stores around here don't let you do it too much.
Oh, really?
And so I don't.
But I was living in France
and there you pay for everything by credit card,
Huh.
but it's not really a credit card
Oh, is it like an automatic debit
or
It's a, it's a debit card,
yeah.
Oh, huh.
And, um, just, you know, it's many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash.
to person in Bye,
thanks.
Oh, really?
Um, yeah.
Because they're just so well set up with it
Yeah.
We use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase,
but we always have the money set aside already to,
and then we just pay it off the next, month.
Right,
well,
We never pay, we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all.
Yeah,
I, I never pay finance charges on them except when I screw up which I occasionally do.
Yeah.
And, you know, I'll forget to pay the bill by the due date,
or this last month I mailed a check to them on the twenty-second
and they didn't get it until the thirtieth,
and it was, due the twenty-fifth.
Gosh.
Uh-huh.
And you know, so I thought I,
and so I got hit up with a uh, finance charge on it which pissed me off because, um, you know, I really did mail it in time.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
But they have no proof of that.
I don't, I don't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it,
but I, I never, um, usually never pay finance charges.
Yeah,
that,
yeah,
we, we screwed up one time like that too.
We mailed it
and they just never did get it,
and we had to finally mail them another check.
I had that hassle one time
and that went on for months and months and months because,
and they eventually found the check and deposited it
Huh.
and months later they were still telling me that I owed them finance charges and, um, late fees and things like that.
And I said, well, I mailed you a check
and you eventually did deposit it.
So, you know, I guess I don't know who the, the burden of proof is on.
Yeah,
I don't either.
You know, kind of the ,
because you never
when I pay bills I don't make a Xerox copy of it
or I don't um,
No,
you figure, you'll get your check back if you have to.
Right.
Or I don't get a, I don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever I, you know, at the bank to have a proof of when I mailed it.
Yeah.
And, I mean you can't do that,
it would be ridiculous.
Really.
I like to use my card if I buy something through the mail which I don't do real often or something from out of state, you know, where if something is wrong, you don't want to end up having to pay for it.
Right.
Well, you can,
A couple times I've had to write big credit card companies and say, you know, I didn't really get this
or I don't know what this is.
Right.
Or I returned it
so don't charge it,
yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer,
and the computer, um, wasn't, didn't do what these people said it would do.
Uh-huh.
We need to just put external cards in
and it wouldn't do that
so he brought it back to them,
and they're supposed to modify it.
And so I called the credit card company and said, well, we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us.
We can't use it.
Uh-huh.
And then they said, well then don't pay it.
And then a month later, I had to dispute it in writing,
and I was out of the country and got back,
and I took care of it as as soon as we got the computer back
and it was okay.
I mailed off a check
but then it was too late.
So now they're hitting me up there with a finance charge.
Oh
But it's sort of, you know,
it's, it's half our fault.
Yes,
it's,
And so
yeah,
if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of,
Right,
if I had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually, it would have been okay.
Yeah.
So I learned that for the next time.
I'm like you, too, about the yearly fees.
Yeah.
I don't, uh, I don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card.
Right now both the MasterCard and the Visa, we don't have to pay a yearly fee on
and since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate, is too, just as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee.
Uh-huh.
Right,
yeah.
Now we had American Express cards
and my husband had always had that before we got married,
and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something I think,
Yeah.
I can't remember
but we decided let that one go
and,
Well, my husband and I both have that
and I don't know what we pay for his card,
I pay I think,
I have a gold one
so, I think it's like seventy-five dollars for me
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and I'm not quite sure what it is for him.
But I had really like
there
nowadays I'm not so sure that it's worth it,
Uh-huh.
but, um, in the past there, you know, there are some places that only take American Express
Yeah.
and then they don't have the credit limit because I've over done the credit limit on the other card,
if my husband and I both travel, it, you know, a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card.
Yeah.
And, um, with the American Express they say there is no limit.
There really is
but they, tell you that,
but then that was one advantage
but that's like,
I don't,
I think it's seventy-five dollars for me and forty for him for a year which is a lot.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Be
But, yeah,
like you said, if you really, if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff, it's more worth it.
Yeah,
well, we should probably get another, um, Visa card, one, another one that's free.
Uh-huh.
Because there are some,
like I think A T and T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year.
Oh.
Well so,
Yeah,
that wouldn't be too hard to do
Yeah,
and so that's easy enough to do,
and if that's true, that's, um, it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit. And get rid of the American Express because it costs so much.
Yeah.
Have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to, be stuck with that?
No.
We've never had, that problem either.
No.
I,
and I don't I mean, I guess I do understand the mentality of people doing it
but I don't understand.
because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay.
I have had months where I was shocked at how much had come in because like I thought I would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process
Uh-huh.
and sometimes it comes in right away
and it's like, oh, well, guess, I have to pay that too.
Yeah.
Because like many times I'll I'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking, hey, I won't get that bill until the next bill, not this bill.
Right.
And it will come in on the next one,
you have to pay for it right away anyway.
Yeah
But sometimes the is long .
Like I've had things that I didn't get billed on for two or three months.
Yeah,
I guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something.
Yeah.
Lot of places have
I guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute,  you charge it.
Immediately.
Yeah,
Yeah.
but, that's what happened with us
like we bought a washing machine seven months ago,
Oh.
and that I got billed like the next day
Oh, gosh.
It didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check
but we prefer
like with the credit card you get the automatic, um, one year guarantee so if something breaks, things like that.
Yeah,
that's nice.
You can, uh, return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October
and, you know, if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee.
Right.
And somethings like that are,
Yeah,
I like that feature
and the like if you break it yourself even, you know,
Right.
if you buy something that's breakable.
Or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be
Yeah.
and so, so that's, you know, another advantage. And then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which, um, you , hopefully you never use.
But like if your
but things like if your baggage gets lost, you get money for that to buy new bags and things like that.
Oh, really?
Oh, I didn't know that.
And yeah,
when you rent a car, you get that
and sometimes you get discounts with the cards
and so ...
Well I usually keep up with news by watching A B C news on television and reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING NEWS
and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
Do you get a chance to do it at home
or do you mostly like catch up while you're at work?
Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL?
I'm not sure what you do.
Yeah,
well I, well I,
at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime.
Um.
I use part of my lunch period to, uh, read the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
Well
Then, uh, I read the, the newspaper at home generally in the evening.
I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning.
I understand that.
Well and you have a little bit better newspaper.
The DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper.
Lubbock is kind of small
and the A J uh, kind of dominant.
There's no competition, so what you get is what you get.
We used to take the paper every day
and I finally quit taking it because it stacked up.
I never got around to reading it
and so I try to take, you know, weekend papers,
Yeah.
and then during the week, I catch up, you know, on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home
and hopefully I'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where I can kind of get a recap on T V, uh.
Yeah,
that's, uh, what we do to,
it, we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television,
No
so we catch the ten o'clock news,
Yeah
But I catch the news on the radio coming to and from work,
but radio news is, is rather short. Uh,
It is.
most of the news stations, most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour.
Uh-huh.
And if you catch the news stations, uh, you don't catch that much in the car.
Oh, I see.
Yeah
but, uh,
uh, it's frustrating to me because I really wish that I did have more I don't know, uh, what do I want to say? I wish that I was around more news.
It's frustrating when I don't know what's going on.
I feel like it's hit and miss
and I haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis.
Somebody will say, oh did you hear about this that happened last week
and it might be local
and it might be national
and I'm like, no, I missed that one
Yeah,
I have the same situation.
I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT,
Yeah.
and they'd just stack up.
I wouldn't find time to read them.
You have to have time to sit down and concentrate on, on the stories
or  all of a sudden you look and there's three, uh, three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
Uh-huh.
and you wind up throwing them out without reading them.
Yeah,
that's true.
Because it's too much trouble to try and catch up,
so have to depend,
That's true,
I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, uh, my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section.
Uh, oh no
There's is all, uh, strictly television news.
A little bit that worries me, because I feel like the news is so biased.
Oh, yeah.
And yes,
they report facts,
and yes
you can get an idea of what's going on,
but, you know, it's, an,
and I wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out.
But so many times you get, well, uh, this is my opinion of what he meant by that,
Yeah.
and I'm like, who are you to judge. You know,
Right,
it's the same  thing with, the news magazines, like TIME and, and the other magazines.
just report the facts.
Uh-huh.
It's hard to uh, to celebrate, to separate the news from the comment, because,  in the way it's presented their opinions is print, or presented as being the news.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news.
And I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized.
I feel like they focus too much on things that, I don't know, you know,
so much during the Gulf War, they would ask questions that, uh, you wouldn't want broadcast.
It's like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is.
That's right.
But they keep asking these questions
and I thought it was really, well I don't know, asinine actually.
Right.
Stupid.
Well so many of them also come through
and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time. Whether it be the homeless or, uh, cancer or whatever
and then they devote, uh, an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind.
Uh-huh,
yes.
And, uh, uh,  particularly the local television. Uh, I know the, the Wednesday's Child bit
I agree.
and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something.
I'm not saying that's not important,
Yeah.
but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects.
Yeah,
that's true,
that's true,
and it's frustrating.
Yeah,
So I guess, I guess when I get to listen to the news, it's, it's probably television or radio.
I see very little paper
but, I, I don't get to see that as much as I want
and when I do I'm wondering why I wanted to see it so bad
That's, yeah, that makes sense.
We, uh, again,
like I say, by the time I read the newspaper it's the, the it's that morning's news from the day before
and I'm reading it in the evening,
so.
Yeah.
I'm a, I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway
Exactly,
exactly.
Yeah.
Well I'm glad
it makes me feel like I'm not alone, though, in the world.
I, I used to think that I was probably the only one that just, I don't know, was running around so much.
I look at other, uh, women workers or, men at work,  that have kids and families
Yeah.
and I'm like, how do they seem so together all the time.
I always feel like I'm running a rat race.
Yeah,
we, we,
So, I guess news is just part of that rat race for me.
Yeah,
yeah
my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own.
Yeah.
It's always, there's something going on all the time, uh,
you don't really have time to sit down and, and thoroughly read a newspaper.
Exactly.
As a matter of fact I read the Sunday paper this evening.
Well.
We had such a busy day yesterday.
Didn't find time to even read it.
Yeah,
that's incredible too.
Yeah,
well that's about all then.
Well I appreciate talking to you.
Nice talking with you.
Have a good evening.
Same to you.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Okay,
there we go.
Okay,
great.
So, do you play golf at all?
Yeah,
I do,
I'm a player.
I'm kind of embarrassed I'm talking to a man, cause I'm sure that you are, you play a lot more than I do.
Actually, I don't.
Oh, really.
No,
uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit
and I was horrible,
so I just stopped playing.
Oh, well, my husband is, is a very good golfer.
He has got, like a six handicap.
Wow,
that is real good.
So, uh,
and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.
So, I had to start playing because, he was, you know, such an avid golfer.
So, I have been playing now,
well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.
Wow,
so you have been playing,
But, but, I really enjoy it.
So, I had to check that and, and, uh, talk about it.
Well, have you played recently?
No,
actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um
Oh
That seems to have been a mistake,
I don't know. Um.
Oh, that's okay.
Yeah,
I have not played in a long time.
Um, when I was,
about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him
and, and I basically, um, I had a horrible slice or hook,
I forget which one it was.
Yeah.
It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
the slice goes to the right
and the hook goes to the left,
I think.
Yes,
I was slicing, actually.
Yeah.
And, as it turns out, uh, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, I would lose so many balls, and, uh, make it a horrible time for everybody.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I went and took some lessons,
and a I got a little bit better,
but I but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,
and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.
And I, And I still have this slice ,
Yeah,
I think that's really a good thing to do.
So, where, are you in your life,
I mean, are you in school?
I'm a graduate student,
yeah.
Oh, okay,
at the University of Rochester?
Yes.
Oh, great.
As a matter of fact, um, so I don't have time to do much else, except for graduate work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right,
so I hang around this way,
and I,
Sure.
Occasionally, uh, uh,
a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers. Golfers, so we will go out
Uh-huh.
and we will, we will, we will play, you know.
And you don't, you don't have the length of the playing time that we do.
I have, I have very at the moment I have very little playing time.
When I, when I go on vacation, my father and I, uh play a little bit.
Yes.
But, I don't, you know,
we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.
Because, .
Oh, that's my favorite kind to play.
Because, for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because, that's my, I can't hit a driver very far
Yeah.
and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,
I use a three iron off the tee because, I have more control over it.
Um.
Uh-huh.
And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.
So, I'm still using a three iron
and my husband is trying to get me into using a, you, know, like a high number wood instead.
Right.
But, those are, uh, still not you favorite, huh?
No,
it's not my favorite,
but, I, I, uh, I enjoy,
I, I really do,
I think I'm going to like golf the older I get, and the more time I have to play.
I, we have three teenage daughters.
Uh, wow, .
One is,
You must be very busy.
Yeah,
I'm very busy,
I have a part time job
and, and during the year, I don't play much golf
but, but, when I'm, we are on vacation, I love to play. Just like you said.
Um.
And, we got to play in Monterrey in California, right, you know, along the Pacific Ocean, this past spring.
And that was, I told my husband, that was the way to play, you know,
that was,
if I could play there every time I want, it was, it was great.
A neat experience
Miniature golf, there's my game. Uh.
Miniature golf is great,
yes.
Miniature golf, there you go, putt, putt.
Well, that's the thing my kids like to do that with, you know, on dates and stuff.
Uh.
But, golf is um,
we, we probably are talking about golf because I did check it You know .
I don't, I don't, I don't
I may have, actually, I may have just checked random things.
I don't, I don't recall anymore.
Well, yeah,
if you ever played,
I mean, I feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it
and maybe if you can even talk about it, if you, if you have, uh, watched it on T V.
Right.
Yeah,
actually, we have a very very, um,
we had the, uh,
Yeah,
tell me about your clubs up there.
What,
Well, we had,
I haven't played around here too much.
We have a very good one called Locust Hill though.
There, uh, the
Locust Hill?
Yeah,
the L P G A comes here every year the Rochester International.
Uh-huh,
right.
And then we had a P G A, actually, a very big P G A, uh, tour stop here, last year.
Oh, great.
And, actually, um, they say the, the,
I have not played the course,
but, they say the course is very, is, is, is pretty tough, pretty challenging.
Uh-huh.
And it's, um, not only that,
but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.
Oh, yeah.
Because, those are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, you know,
they kept saying, we hear, you know, on, on television I,
but, they keep saying it's just wonderful, uh,
the course is so well maintained
and, you know, it, it, it rained through half the um, tournament, so people had to ,
but, they still,
the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about, getting things back up again.
Oh, yeah.
And this,
actually, when, when the, um, when the L P G A came here I guess that was about a week and a half ago, it was just, it, it takes over the whole town.
Uh-huh.
Oh, sure.
You know. It's all over the news,
and lots and lots of people take off work, to go to go an watch the, the, uh, ladies like some loss of words play.
Yes.
Yeah.
To watch them,
yeah.
The ladies,
So, I mean, I think it's actually, it's absolutely wonderful to see.
Yeah,
I'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here.
Yeah,
uh.
People are just
golf is just,
it's just the coming thing,
I mean a lot of people are just crazy about it.
It seems to be.
It seems a lot of people are really, you know,
either, um, either you have not played it, or, or you, you have played it
and you sort of stink, like me,
Well, it's, it's just such a difficult thing.
and you sort of play every now and then.
I mean it's, I just, I watch my husband
and he's, he was a professional athlete,
he, he's a very good athlete
and he's got the coordination, that God given coordination,
and he just struggles, you know, all the time, to um, to master this game.
Yeah.
Yeah,
well, same here, I mean, I'm a brown belt in Karate at this point in time.
And, uh, And, and I can not, and I can not hit a golf ball
Oh my, really!
Yeah.
You know I,
Because it,
well, I watch my husband swing
and his swing, you know, like compared to the pros, is so, it's ridged.
It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement. You know.
Right.
That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.
oh yeah.
And I worry about that.
Oh, yeah.
I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,
I have got to hit it.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have this nasty habit of of turning my head at the last second, or, or just keeping my arm wrong.
Yep,
or,
Yeah,
turning your head is probably the most common thing for women, they say.
Is it?
And you are always so anxious to see where it goes.
Right,
exactly.
Uh-huh.
Exactly,
It's just like I, I don't watch the ball die,
I have .
It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.
Yeah,
yeah,
I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long you know, than with a driver or something.
Oh, driver.
Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green
Yeah.
and you want to see it hit the green.
And you know that's why,
Watch where it's going.
Yeah,
so. I I don't know what I'm supposed to ask questions about,
That, that is certainly true
thank you .
am I supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure,
I know that.
That's okay,
go ahead,
it's no big deal.
Well, uh, when I,
do you get, get, um, reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too?
Both.
Both.
Okay.
I believe so.
Okay,
well I really did not know so I,
I, I, I actually don't know,
I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out,  until afterward
Yeah.
Okay.
Cause this is only my second day doing it
and I just did not, I did not know
and that was .  the details,
Oh, really.
we, I just started yesterday.
I have been doing this for awhile, actually.
Have you?
It seems like it's been a while.
Yeah.
And they just, I just,  get these random checks in the mail every now and then
I had a ,
and,
I see.
My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.
I see.
And we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail
and, To be honest, I, I really have not been accounting,
Yeah.
I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.
Uh-huh.
You know, if it works, it works.
So ,
Well, my, uh,
Okay,
do you, uh, think we should go metric?
Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.
It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system,
Yeah.
obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens
and things make sense.
Um, it's, it's a switch.
The problem would just be the switch over.
Yeah.
I think that the, I think what,
I mean, I don't know what happened last time.
I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something
and,
Right.
That's when I was in the elementary school years
and we all, We all learned that metric
Yeah,
me too.
and they were ready,
we were going to be metric
and,
Right,
and, and I don't quite know why it failed.
Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.
Right.
You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it,
so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out
so,
So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric
Yeah.
and, and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.
We have metric cola now,
Right,
I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.
you can buy that
and you can,
You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.
So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,
but no one talks about, you know, uh,
you buy nine by twelve frames,
you don't buy centimeter length frames, and cooking pans.
Right.
And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers,
you don't say,
I went, a hundred kilometers. You know.
Uh-huh .
Right,
fifty-nine kilometers per gallon.
Yeah.
I would, I would be total loss.
Yeah.
That's,
I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, you know,
Right.
and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed
and, pardon my expression there, but, uh, who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.
Uh-huh.
But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up.
Yeah,
it really would.
It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, you know, get that in our minds, so that we could I mean
because I think our generation could make a change.
Yeah.
It would be difficult,
but it would not be as difficult for people, say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.
Right.
That's
Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.
Right.
And if they kept it up,
so let's say, imagine they had kept going,
you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system.
Right.
Not like could use it comfortably right now,
but I could convert, you know,
I could carry around a little conversion card or something
and, I could handle it for a while, and then, and then eventually I'd learn,
Right
and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.
Right.
And now I think there are enough people,
you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch,
and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying, what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.
We'll say oh, it's a pain in the neck,
but it's for the better
and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.
That's true.
That makes sense.
I don't know.
I, I, I would hope it would, uh,
it seems like it's a reasonable system.
I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.
Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,
and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.
Right
When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,
Centimeters.
and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds.
Yeah.
But I wonder if, if,
So all the dieters would be happy
But yeah
right
I only weigh sixteen today.
That's,
Yeah.
But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they have to change immediately.
They could just, you know, sort of phase that in,
so start, you know, from now,
like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something.
Right.
And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that, tells you how tall the robbers are when they, to hold it up.
That's right.
I know the,
and, oh, yeah,
I know, though, at the, uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty-two, inches or something. You can't walk in here.
Right.
You have to be under.
Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, uh,
see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.
Right.
this line, which is seventy-three centimeters.
That's right.
Just so you'll know,
It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.
Right.
Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world?
I know England is not metric.
But I don't know.
I, I don't think they are, because our, um, our measurements started in England,
England is not?
Oh.
all that began back there,
and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric.
Yeah,
but I mean,
but, but virtually the rest of the world is.
I mean, it seems like like, like, like sort of stupid.
Right.
I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans
and we're supposed to be, you know,
We're the trend setters in the world.
I don't know why we, We haven't changed to the sensible system.
That's right,
and, and now we're backwards.
I don't know.
No,
I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense.
Right.
Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything,
is it?
It,
No,
actually, no.
Um, let's see,
it's,
Well, pounds,
I don't even know what that,
I don't know.
Oh, yeah,
I, I always forget.
I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound.
I just sort of make it up.
See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.
It's,
I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would prevent me from,
Right
Those, those wouldn't be a problem.
It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.
A lot of stuff,
Let's see,
how many cups equal that?
I, I have no idea.
I just, uh,
I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.
Right
I don't, I didn't even know that
That's all I know.
I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine,
I, I had two friends,
and, I had more friends than that,
but two friends of mine in college,
I had a lot more than two,
I promise.
Well, that's good.
Um, we opened a jelly bean business.
Oh.
And we sold jelly beans,
and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know,
we, we didn't we didn't bother buying a scale.
Right.
We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.
Right.
And we, we didn't bother buying a scale,
and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major
and he said, well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around,
and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.
Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint?
Gee, I think, I think he the calculation at home,
and it turns out that he was actually pretty close.
Um.
If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.
Right.
So, so we were giving them a little too much,
but that was our general tendency anyway.
Well, that's,
you all are nice business
Yeah,
well, we were, you know, we were in,
it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school,
we really didn't, make, you know,
Right.
I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year. You know, after, after an entire semester,
Right
but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.
Probably ate all your merchandise too.
Yeah,
we, we, we tended to eat a lot,
and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it,
and we had another friend, um, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess,
Uh-huh.
and he got into a snowball fight, with the jelly beans nearby,
and he just,
and, and some snow fell into one of the cartons.
Oh.
So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off
And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.
Yeah,
it's a little problem.
What's inside the jelly bean?
Uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, the same,
they're like an outer coating,
and there's just sort of this stuff you see, you know, it's sort of like glorified sugar.
I don't know.
Uh, oh.
But when you rinse them off, all you get is, uh, is, uh, the coating,
I guess we are just to discuss trials and, and punishment. If it's to be given by the judge or not.
Did you, did you catch your explanation of that?
Yes,
I did.
It's, it's, uh,
Okay.
The, uh,
maybe I'm a hard liner
but I think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases. Rather than, uh, degrees of sentencing.
You mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime?
Right.
Right.
Okay
Uh, again, having participated in jury duty myself, I know  I know how such a diverse group of people get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, that  sometimes you can have one person or two, that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing, of the person.
Yes,
I did also.
Right.
Could you hang on one minute Jim?
Yes ma'am.
Thank you
I am so sorry to keep you on hold.
No problem.
Are you at work?
Yes.
Okay,
I am too. Um,
Yeah.
Um, I think what you have is, the way the, the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty.
Oh, it's insane.
So many things in their back,
pardon?
It's insane.
Yes.
I know,
my wife participated in a jury trial several years back wherein the individual after it was over and they, had came up with the maximum sentence in the jury form they found out that, uh, the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of  uh, property.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh yes.
And yet, the the attorney, for the prosecution could not enter these, uh, the good man's background into it.
It was like, this was a first time offender.
Yes.
Whereas, uh, I think that's,
It seems like ,
Those that should be in jail should be in jail
That's correct
and there's too much leniency,
there's too much, uh, um, underhanded, uh, things going on that the public are not aware of.
Yeah
And it seems as though we are, uh, giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim.
The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also, the courts that try to do the justice.
Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a, a, unsavory reputation,
shall we say?
I do not have any, I don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the, the judicial system in the United States.
Yeah
Well, what you got is the situation wherein, uh, if you ever get in trouble, you want to hire the smartest, crookedest, lawyer you can find.
Isn't that terrible?
And, uh, that's not the idea.
It's, the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime,
Well, to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking.
To get him out of that, uh, uh, criminal mind that he has and to direct, him into a more productive life.
Yeah
Well we have, uh, a situation again that I am familiar with where, uh, the son of an acquaintance of mine  was killed while trying to stop a robbery.
Uh-huh.
Oh
Yes,
how sad.
And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, carrying a gun in her purse.
Uh-huh.
And, anyway it'd get to the,
she was sentenced to jail
but then due to technicalities, she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced.
Oh.
Of course it took eighteen months for the thing, the trial to happen.
Right.
So, then, uh, there was a letter writing campaign that went in,
and the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone.
And, uh, fortunately it worked.
They, uh, they corrected the technicality.
Well if,
And the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to.
Yes.
If enough of the public, responded to, uh, the the, uh, parties that are involved, and if enough,
they will listen to the voice of the people.
I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done, something is going to change.
Right.
People have to be involved.
sipping through a This is it
Yeah.
and most people don't take the time.
That's right.
Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted  with these people.
That's right.
I'm just  as guilty as the rest in that respect.
You were,
Yes.
Uh, but, and I'm not making an excuse
but we, our priorities are a bit backward.
Oh yes.
Well, they, again the,
and I'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that,
but we've gone, overboard to, uh, protect persons from being, having their civil rights, violated to the point where the person that is damaged, is not protected.
It's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person, that commits the crimes.
That's correct.
Yeah
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think we're both in agreement on this subject.
Well, I am too.
I mean I, I just can't.
I, you know, I served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem
and we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind.
So if the person is not in the right mind, I mean they had to, uh, put her away.
Yeah.
But for her own safety and for, because she didn't know what she was doing.
And we couldn't, we just dismissed the case.  You know,
Yeah.
and, and, she was, uh, taken care of by the proper facility.
Yeah.
Well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court.
There are a lot of things that could be settled out of court which, uh, or should never have gone to court.
Yes,
that's true.
And then the amazing thing, of course, is how, uh, some cases can come to trial in thirty days,
and others it takes eighteen months
Carolyn, I have a little Schnauzer, little miniature Schnauzer.
Oh.
What do you have?
Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society
You know, those make the best animals, uh, best pets.
My, uh, son has a, uh, oh,
it's a real mixture,
it's part, uh, Doberman and part Husky
Oh, my.
Yes,
and they, gentlest dog you ever met,
and they got him from the, uh, Humane Society here in Oklahoma City
Oh,
and she's just turned out to be a jewel.
My, my little Schnauzer is, is my friend.
She is so spoiled.
She's a year and a half old now,
and being single, she's become very important in my life
Uh-huh.
it's so nice to have, come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.
Well, my children are the ones that wanted our pet,
and this one is probably the best one that we have had.
Um, as I say, we got it from the Humane Society,
and, uh, we had lost a pet,
and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost.
It got out under the fence while we were on vacation,
and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it,
but, uh, when we walked in to the, to the Humane Society, this little dog was, uh, in the office and would sit up and beg,
and just, oh, he was so cute,
and the kids just fell in love with it.
We just couldn't leave without it.
But, it's, um, whoever had it before must have trained it real well, because it's just, you know, it's, uh, a good house dog.
I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it
Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one, it's a puppy, because I work
and I'm not home
Uh-huh.
and unfortunately she's not as well trained as, as I would like her to be
Uh-huh.
and I realize it's my fault,
I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian,
but, uh,
It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly,
It is,
it is.
She's, you know, she's real good,
I can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything,
Um.
and, and, not one mess does she make
Oh.
and then we go outside,
and she'll stay outside for, oh, thirty minutes to an hour, come inside and use the restroom.
Um.
I just want to kill her at those times.
Oh.
But she's a doll,
she's a love,
she really is.
About the only time we have,
well, I shouldn't say the only time,
but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night,
and, uh, she usually stays inside at night.
We try to take her out right before we go to sleep,
but, uh, sometimes it doesn't work
You know, I, I, we always had a pet when I was growing up, oh always had a dog.
My mother did not like cats.
So we always had a dog,
and, and then, course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet
Uh-huh.
and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog,
Oh.
I, uh, in fact my children gave me this, this little puppy for Christmas.
What a cute idea.
Yeah,
I think so
Well, we got one one year for Christmas,
and, uh, I had a baby the next day
Oh, my goodness.
and, uh, so that one wasn't really well trained
Two babies,
huh.
Oh.
Oh, I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time,
so,
That, that is really probably bad timing.
Yeah,
I
it was,
it really was.
The older kids had wanted one, though,
and, you know, we thought, well that would be a fun time for them to have it, you know, get it at Christmas time.
It was a little Spitz, a little white fluffy and, you know, looked like it came right from the north pole,
Oh, yes,
and that was fun,
but, um, I, I sure wasn't good at training it
Do you
I think you have to have time, you know to do those things.
and patience
and you have to, you really have to be, just like your children,
when you set a rule you have to stand by it, and be consistent
That's right.
and ...
Well, um, since I'm in college, uh, I mean, uh, I haven't seen that much change
I'm kind of young still,
I don't know how much it changed in the last, uh, twenty years anyway.
But, I don't know.
Do you, do you have an idea of, of how much.
No,
I'm not that old either
Uh-huh.
I'm only twenty-nine.
Oh, okay.
So, social changes aren't that much for me either.
Yeah,
right.
Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days
and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh the way, the way people dress
Well, yeah,
that.
and, uh.
I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
More lax?
Uh-huh,
relaxed and laid back and stuff
Uh-huh.
and.
Maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be.
I think so.
Uh-huh.
I think so,
and a lot,
I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.
Right.
Uh, yeah,
maybe people are a little, a little more, uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
Oh, yeah.
Right.
and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
Right.
Just wasn't socially acceptable.
No,
huh-uh.
Yeah.
Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know,
and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS
and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.
Right.
Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
Uh-huh.
and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,
well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
right.
Yeah.
but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
Yeah.
It wasn't that long that I was that young.
Yeah.
And I've got a ten year old,
and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms,
and and he knows about AIDS,
Uh-huh.
and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Right.
It used to be that we were, that we were trying to protect morality.
Now it's we're protecting our lives.
It's a it's a much different,
Uh-huh.
we have, you know,
you can't just, just hope for abstinence.
No,
I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part.
I mean that's, sex is rampant,
Yeah.
and it always will be,
and and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
Uh-huh.
and, and they sit down
and they look at you right in the face
and they expect a truthful answer.
That's right.
You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.
Yeah.
They, they,
that just does not go.
Right.
And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know
Uh-huh.
But it, it's interesting, listening to them.
I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation.
Uh-huh.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
I, I, I imagine you're right.
I, I teach swim lessons a lot,
and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know,
kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.
Yeah,
I do too.
You know, besides what, besides what they learn, uh, from, from our social environment is, uh, their education is just amazing.
Kids are, kids are learning, uh, you know,
their math is just,
every year, uh, algebra goes down a grade, you know,
and, and, uh, students learn it earlier.
I know,
well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
Uh, which ones have you seen lately?
Oh, I just sort of blanking tonight.
I just got done saying I just saw one, uh, fairly recently.
Uh, oh, gosh, oh, I know, uh, uh, the one with the two girls that take off from, uh, uh, across, across the country on a crime spree.
THELMA AND LOUISE,
THELMA AND LOUISE,
yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't seen that.
Is it good?
Yeah,
it really is,
it's, it's interesting.
Is it?
Oh, yeah,
it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.
Yeah.
That's true.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And even,
I, I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.
Uh-huh.
And, I mean, that kind of surprises me
I mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up,  enough to use it again,
Yeah.
but they can.
Uh-huh.
Um, I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,
Yeah.
I I don't know either.
That's,
I know that though, I, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, the water table.
Uh-huh.
You know, they really pollute quickly
and, you know, one,
Uh-huh.
Wow.
So, it's one of those things that they really,
Yeah
Yeah.
I know
Yeah,
how terrible that is.
So, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, I guess.
Really.
Uh-huh.
I know I really,
I don't know,
I, I think that, I mean, I think that they really are doing a good thing now
and I hope it keeps,
well, I'm sure we'll keep up.
Yeah.
I,  agree.
You know,
I think it's really catching on.
Uh-huh.
You know, I, I think that,
I'm not sure if it,
I don't know,
I think it's a good idea to make it mandatory
I do, too.
Um, it,
because like we were asking some people that live in, um, North Dakota, Well, are you saving your, you know, are you recycling.
And they said, Well, we're not forced to do it yet,
so no.
Uh-huh.
You know, so, I mean I don't know,
I think that if people are forced, if the people are not forced to do it they may not, you,  know.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know,
I think a lot of people still will,
You know, I know that it's really funny.
My parents are forced to do it
and they,
Well, I personally don't have any problem with, uh, drug testing employees or potential employees, do you?
Um,
I mean, basically?
Basically, no.
Okay.
I don't,
I really can't disagree with it.
I, I, uh, uh,
the policy that T I has, I think is, uh, uh, very fair.
Uh-huh.
Um, I,
they first had a policy where they, uh, would test new employees
and, then since I've been with them the last four years, uh, there's been in the last year, year and a half, um, they're doing random testing of all employees.
Uh-huh.
I think that's really the only fair way to do it.
Yes.
I really think it ought to be
you know, Junkins all the way down.
And it is,
it,
and from what I understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down.
Right,
as a matter of fact, I want to think they took the top managers first,
isn't that a fact?
I've been retired from T I about a year,
Uh-huh.
but the program, you know, was still fairly new.
I guess it had been going on, maybe almost a year,  before I retired,
Uh-huh.
so I was not, uh, ever called upon to do a drug test.
I certainly wouldn't object to it,
and I think random is probably, you know, the only really fair way to do it.
Yeah.
Um, I like it because, um,
you know, I, I, I grew up in the sixties,
Uh-huh.
and,  and, uh, you know, I, I saw,
Uh-huh.
you know, I know my friends who were you know, druggies and,  friends who weren't
Uh-huh.
and, and, uh, you know, it's, I think it's a real problem,
Uh-huh.
Oh, I,
absolutely.
and I think it, and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and,  and a lot of problems.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And so I'm hoping that, uh, a lot of other companies will, will follow the same path.
I don't think they'll have much choice, do you?
Um, probably not.
Especially if they have anything do with, you know, government contracts, or anything.
As matter of fact, I want to believe that the, uh, defense department more or less mandated that people, you know, who work on defense contracts, you know,  do some sort of, you know, drug testing.
Uh-huh.
I think that's really what maybe prompted T I to do it.
I was in the, uh, Defense Electronic Division when I retired.
I know it was, a, you know, it was a real hot, hot item there.
I think, I want to think maybe they, you know, really got some nudging from, you know, D O D to do this sort of thing.
Yeah,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So you you know the atmosphere, then.
Yep.
So, yeah.
Very aware of it.  uh, like, you know, school systems, and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right,
I agree.
I,
I mean, I'd like, I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or,  or, uh, who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs.
That's right.
That's
absolutely.
Yeah,
I
I just can't disagree with you , with you know the basic premise.
Yeah.
It's to
as far as I know, it's, you know, seems to be a fairly accurate program, as far as, uh, you know, the testing goes.
And, uh,
And, I like the idea that they have a, uh, system where they allow you to, uh, be retested if for,  some reason there may have been a problem.  or something did show up.
That's right.
That's right.
And offer you, you know, help if you need help.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
rather than just, uh put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself.
Yeah.
That's right.
That's not going to help anybody get over the problem.
No,
I believe it is a, a, a medical problem.
That's right.
Um, of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world, too
Oh, absolutely.
Not to mention alcohol.
Yeah,
so I mean, there's a lot of things out there
Yep,
yep.
I'm just glad that they, uh, decided not to, uh, tax drugs, otherwise they'd be legal,
Uh-huh.
and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way,  they are the alcohol and tobacco
That's right
That's right
oh, gosh.
Well, it's, it's a real problem,
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Yeah.
I have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy,  and, and stuff,
Uh-huh.
and I, uh, uh, I moved to a T I facility that, um, had never had, uh, random drug sampling before,  because they were outside of the military sector.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
It was, uh, an industrial company, and, you know, that T I purchased,
and so the people here, a lot of them are real opposed to it.
Oh, yeah,
uh-huh.
Uh, they were really opposed to it,
Uh-huh.
and, you know, there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs,
Uh-huh.
and that's why they were opposed to it.
That's right.
And, uh, it resulted in, in a few people leaving, you know, because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You know, they had a life-style
and they weren't going to change it.
Yeah,
right.
And it's,
Yeah,
I know a lot of people who, when it first
or at least began, was in the talking
you know, everybody knew it was coming,
it just a matter of time, everybody was screaming, you know, invasion of privacy and all this stuff.
But a lot of people, I think, after they thought about it for awhile, and you know, weighed the pros and cons, decided, you know, it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs, of course.
Yeah.
I mean, uh, you should have no objection to it,
it's like, uh, going down to get your license and checking your eyes.
That's right.
I mean, you know, why do I need my eyes checked,
Uh-huh.
That's right,
yep,
yep.
You know it's like, why are we doing this?
Well, so you don't kill people on the road.
That's right.
Or yourself
or,
Uh, it's a
I mean, it's the basic premise with,  you know, drug testing.
Yeah.
That's right.
Especially some of the jobs, um,
luckily I've always been in the engineering sector,
Uh-huh.
and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as, uh, you know, hurting someone, I mean,
Uh-huh.
it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it,
Yeah.
That's true.
But, uh, in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor,  and down in some of those labs and stuff, yeah, I, darn if I'd want somebody down there that I'm working with side by side, you know, that could kill me, by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
assembly people.
That's right.
That's
absolutely.
So, there's a, there's a lot of sectors where I think that would, would help out,
and I think in the long run, we all benefit.
Uh-huh,
oh, absolutely,
yeah.
I mean, if you have, uh,
you know, if you're not working with someone on drugs, well then you're going to have less accidents,
Uh-huh.
and you have less accidents
and you spend less money on medical.
Uh-huh.
And you spend less money on medical, then the company's more profitable.
Yeah.
The company's more profitable,  then maybe they can pay you more.
Sure
right .
If they can pay you more, you can buy more,
Uh-huh.
and then, and it,
and it goes around,  you know, to everywhere.
Sure.
Trickles, trickles up and down.
Yep,
all over.
Sure does.
And, uh,
Yeah,
affects a lot of people.
It certainly does
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and, and, and start it up.
I think they probably will.
You know, if, if they,
I'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer.
I'm not sure every small company could do it.
Well, a lot of companies are, are, coming down in price,
Uh-huh.
and I think that the insurance companies are starting to give, uh, benefits.
Uh-huh.
You know, reduction in, in medical costs if, you know, they,
Uh-huh,
yeah,
yeah,
it's got to help them too.
Yeah,
so, I think everybody will, will benefit from the program.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
I do too,
that's right.
And I think if, if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say,  well if you impose, uh,  mandatory drug testing, we'll reduce your insurance costs by,  you know, twenty per cent.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And of course, you know, the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent, they're going to reduce their own.
No,
no.
But it'll save in some areas,
yeah,
right.
Yeah,
and that'll cover it.
And maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a, uh, as part of the package.
That's right.
That certainly could happen.
That's a very very, very competitive business.
Yeah.
So it,
I, I think, I think all around it, it's going to help out a lot.
Yeah.
I do too.
Course,
I just really can't disagree with you.
Yeah.
Okay,
well, it's nice to talk to you.
It was great talking with you.
And you take care.
You do the same.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
So, the topic is vacations?
Alright,
that's a good, that's a good topic, huh?
I think so.
I enjoy them.
Where did you go on your last vacation?
Uh, the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents.
It was,
What?
The last one was back down to Lubbock, Texas,  to visit family.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
Uh.
But that's not the tradition for us.
Oh, yeah.
What's your out of the, out of the state type,
where do you like to go?
Uh, we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year.
Really?
Yeah.
What kind of, uh, vacation spots are there in Colorado?
Oh, Rocky Mountain National Park.
Uh-huh.
It's, it's just like any of the other national parks.
It,
you know, there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching
and,
I think my parents took me there when I was real young.
We went to Colorado Springs and, uh, Rocky Mountain National Park.
It was real pretty.
Oh, it's,
Got to see Pike's Peak.
Yeah,
we usually try and drive up there, oh, once every year or two.
You drive by yourself up there?
Sure.
Oh, wow.
To the top the of the peak,
sure.
Oh, that's tough.
I don't, I don't think I could do that
Oh, it's not bad at all.
It's, it's a beautiful drive.
Oh.
Now I admit up there, the altitude is kind of interesting,
Yeah,
yeah.
You know you get a little lightheaded and giddy,
but it's fun. You know, take along a picnic lunch
and,
Sure is pretty up there.
Oh, we love it.
You have mountains all around you?
Uh, no,
Uh-huh.
you know, it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies.
You know, and once a week we drive up into the mountains, usually, you know, usually once a week, once every other week.
Wow,
that's neat.
I'm jealous
There's hills in Texas.
Yeah,
well, I enjoy hills, in Texas too.
I've been in Sherman.
No,
I haven't,
you?
Uh, once to Mexico City,
but just a little day thing on business.
Uh-huh.
I went to, uh, the Bahamas last year, on a cruise for my honeymoon.
Uh, that's nice.
It was really neat,
I had never been out of, really, out of Texas or out of Indiana much, out of the United States.
I'm from Indiana
so,
Did you enjoy it?
What?
Did you enjoy it?
Yeah,
it was great.
Uh-huh.
It was really pretty down there.
Uh, got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture
and,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
really did.
There,
in fact, one, uh, family that sat at our table every meal was from London,
Oh.
and they had never been to the United States,
so they were really enjoying it
and they were telling us about all their trips.
Huh.
They had been to Disneyland,
and it was neat to meet different people.
So the place that I went, that we've gone on vacation that I think I enjoyed the most,  was Seattle.
Uh-huh.
Oh, really?
I've heard it's really pretty up there.
Well, we, uh,
was, two years ago,  we went during the drought.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
I'm sorry, three years ago.
It had been dry for a whole week.
Oh, wow.
It didn't rain for a whole week.
Yeah
that would have been nice.
That would have been best time to go.
Yeah,
somehow we picked the right time and, uh, walked down on the wharf,
and I think we ate seafood every meal for, well, not quite every meal, but most meals for a week.
Uh-huh.
Uh, it was wonderful.
Uh, the Pacific Science Museum, the little girl really enjoyed.
It's very interesting.
Pacific Science?
Yeah.
Really?
Yes.
It was, it was super,
and, uh, went to the Seattle Aquarium.
Uh-huh.
And it's right down there, on the, right there on the ocean, and down there on the wharf by the piers and all,
and you walk down in a dome, a glass dome,
Uh-huh.
and the bay is circulating over your head,
and you,  and you can watch the fish swim by and sharks
Oh, wow.
and oh it's,
Oh, neat.
Yeah,
and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises, and oh, it's,  it's amazing.
That's the vacation you recommend, huh?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.
Without a doubt.
Seattle is beautiful,
and the mountains,  the mountains to the east of Seattle,  are just incredible.
Yeah,
I've heard it is.   Uh-huh.
Really?
I rode a ferry for the first time in my life.
Oh, wow.
You know, up there, you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry,  Instead of by bridge.
Uh-huh.
And you drive your car on.
You park your car,
you set your brake.
You walk upstairs
and you have a beer,  or coffee, or whatever, depending on the time of day.
It's amazing.
And your car is on a ferry?
Yes.
And it goes across with you?
Yes.
That's really neat.
Yeah,
yeah.
And there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry, you know, and drive, on to it,
To work?
yeah,
live on an island off, off shore from Seattle.
That's really wild.
And, you, uh,
everyday they drive on the ferry.
They go upstairs and have their morning coffee.
Huh.
Take, for the twenty to, hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and, you know, depending on where it is.
Hour and ten minutes?
Well, in some places, you know,  in some areas, you know, depends on how far they are commuting.
Yeah.
That's really interesting.
Oh, it, it's strict,
I'm, I'm a West Texan.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You know, it's, it's a different life style than we are used to.
Yeah,
it is.
I've been wanting to go to the West Texas, and see different parts of Texas, because I haven't lived here very long,
and I haven't really seen much.
So what are some good things in Texas to go visit?
Oh, Galveston.
Galveston?
Yes,
I liked Galveston real well,
uh, there's, uh,
one of the areas down there close to Galveston is,
I forget the name of the island,
Uh-huh.
but it's a bird sanctuary,  with all kinds of wild birds. Whooping and sand hill cranes, and ducks and pelicans
Uh-huh.
and it's very pretty.
Uh-huh.
Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone, to the,  to the Alamo.
Yeah.
Boardwalk and all that.
Yeah,
the river walk.
Oh, it's,
Yeah.
And you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there.
Oh, it's just simply beautiful.
I've heard it's really pretty.
And, of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down to San Antone just,
Really?
Yeah,
and go to, uh, Lone Star,
and uh, you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery,
Yeah
You know, go across the border and all.
Uh, the Davis Mountains are interesting,  out there in West Texas.
Uh-huh.
Down by Big Bend?
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh, now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter,  because, there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be, it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You know, whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at. It's most enjoyable,  to get, you know, to get warm.
Um.
Uh-huh.
That's nice,
uh, down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting.
I love the Texas Hill Country.
Yeah.
And, uh, Austin is neat for, for an occasional visit.
I've heard to go to Austin too.
A lot people say to go down there.
Yeah,
yeah
it's a fun few days. Uh,
What's there to see in Austin?
Oh, U T is real pretty.
Uh-huh.
Uh, there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area, Marble Falls and all.
That's real pretty.
Uh, I would say definitely go see that part
and, uh, I'd say go to, uh, Midland once, just for the heck of it.
I don't know why, exactly.
But, uh, you know, find out when they are holding the petroleum fair, uh,
Okay.
Great.
Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program.
Huh-uh.
I'm mainly do a lot of walking.
I have a son that's a little bit overweight
and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around.
So my wife and I kind of take turns.
At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program.
But, in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down.
All this space that normally would be dedicated towards the, exercise area, is covered in boxes.
Yeah.
Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?
Well, I had, uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups.
Huh-uh.
And then I did some very mild, say, light weight lifting.
Nothing,
I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles, just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age
Huh-uh.
Yeah
Um, right now, um, I try when it's nice out,
it's been raining a lot this spring,
but I try to, uh,
I have a bicycle
and I like to cycle a lot.
And, uh, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas,
I don't know, if it's up north,
Huh-uh.
but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.
Huh-uh.
Um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.
And, um, T I, where I work has, uh, a fitness center
so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,
and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on.
So I try to,
I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis.
I used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,
so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,
but it's a big commitment.
We don't have any kids yet
so, that's a lot of, part of it.
Yeah.
That's a plus.
Oh, I have a total of five children.
I have three left living at home.
Huh-uh.
And they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend.
Yeah.
And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.
Yeah.
It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.
Yes,
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.
Huh-uh
That's why, they, uh, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that.
But it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes
and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.
But it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever.
I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have to,
what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.
Huh-uh.
And you can use what ever rationale you want,
but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.
Right.
And, uh, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,
And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it.
Huh-uh.
If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.
Yeah.
Um, I've been learning a lot lately about, um,
I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper,
I don't know if you're familiar with him
Huh-uh.
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.
He's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.
Um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, * mistranscribed? listen
and what was the other one, I think was, yeah, obesity.
If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,
so anyway, it's kind of a tip.
Yeah.
Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years
and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.
Really
Yeah.
Um, the research that I've done
and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.
Huh-uh.
And, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks.
Huh-uh.
There were none prior to nineteen-hundred.
Well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,
and after that we, we started having the hearts attacks
and, uh, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE.
You can usually find it in a health food store.
Huh-uh.
I know they had it in health food stores in Plano,
I used live in Plano.
Dr. Price?
Uh, Dr. Price,
yeah.
And it's amazing,
he makes the,
you know, it's a very small book
and the guys very opinionated,
um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine.
There were no heart attacks before we started using it
and he points out that people in, uh, England
and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.
Yeah.
He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours. And, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the, clogging of the arteries.
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
And, uh, you know, he's,
there's been a lot of reports since then.
This whole thing about,
first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,
and now they're saying what's cholesterol,
well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.
Huh-uh.
You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book
and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven. And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.
And, E P A never published that report.
And what's the name of this book again?
CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE.
I'll have to remember that.
Yeah.
That will be very interesting.
My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
so, he's really interested in the heart.
Yeah.
And he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too,
he's, uh, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise
Sorry,
he made me laugh.
Um, so anyway,
Yeah.
There is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health.
And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,
Huh-uh.
uh, but to believe some of the things,
you know, and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,
but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe.
If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.
Huh-uh.
That's a real good,
um, he talks about that.
Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.
Yeah.
I actually eat pretty much anything that I want.
Huh-uh.
And I've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times
and I've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty, never.
Huh-uh.
And, uh, uh, I mean, I,
You have a good ratio of good to bad. Cholesterol.
but, I mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing
You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.
Yeah.
But, uh, we've,
I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
Oh, really.
Yeah
and we've had a few of the health fairs up here
and, um, you know, I've always come out aces.
That's good.
You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat,
but I do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber, low in fat and all that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
But, I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, I'm not, cholesterol, I'm not worried about it.
Okay, um, do you like to cook?
Well, I love to cook as a matter of fact I'm making dinner right now
Oh, really,
what are you making?
Um, I, um, I'm making, some, uh,
I have a little turkey left from a passover which was in April.
Uh-huh.
And I had frozen it
and I'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store, which is like, uh, rice pilaf,
Uh-huh.
but we
with, with, with wheat kernel that,
And do you cook,
I mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself?
No,
um, I'm married
and actually the,
my wife is a vegetarian,
Uh-huh.
so this isn't for her,
this is for our friends that came over and helped. helped me do some stuff
Uh-huh.
so,
Uh-huh.
stuff so,
Uh-huh.
he and I,
and, and she's having,
I, I do cook, um, virtually,
I cook most of the time because I,
Uh-huh,
well like if you were having a dinner party what, would you cook a variety of things, I mean, you know, vegetarian and nonvegetarian?
Yeah,
we, we, consistently,
if we cook,
if, if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier.
Uh-huh.
So we'll make something, you know, uh, some sort of pasta or something,  you know, homemade pasta or lasagna or something.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that's something that's, you know, really easy.
In fact I'm having a dinner party next Saturday
and that is what I'm having is pasta.
Oh, good idea.
Well for,  for Christmas I got a, um, pasta machine,
What,
Um.
and all, all my friends are really anxious, you know, to have the homemade noodles
so, um,
Electric or, uh,
No
it's the hand kind,  old fashion kind
Best,  kind.
That, that, that, that's
we, we bought one in Italy.
Uh-huh.
That's the best kind to have.
Yeah,
yeah,
Uh-huh,
that's real good.
But, um, yeah,
so that's what I'm going to be cooking, you know,
Um.
I thought I would
, um, pasta salad first,
and, um, then just something for desert, you know, bread and wine and cheese stuff like that.
That would be great.
Have you made pasta before?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Um, so you know, so you know that it's a, a lot of fun actually.
Yeah,
yeah.
I,
A lot of people think though that I've talked to about it think that it's, you know a lot of hard work
and I said heck it's kind of easy.
It actually is, if, if, if you have a food processor,
I don't know if you have a food processor or not.
Actually,  it, it turns out that if, if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply.
Yeah,
I do.
Uh-huh.
Right,
right.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I making yucky .
Uh-huh.
It's also,
people think it's real hard,
it just time consuming to get all of the little things right.
Uh-huh.
Otherwise it's real ,
Uh-huh.
it's good stuff.
What other kinds of, uh, dinner parties do you serve?
Um, well, I don't entertain that often,
uh, when I do though I, I have some friends that I always like to experiment on.
But, you know, um, I see a recipe and think, oh wow, I'd really like to try this, cause I'm single
and I live by myself,
Uh-huh.
so it's not necessarily something that I would cook just for myself.
Right,
you didn't want to cook.
but, here we go
and usually I'm, I'm pretty good about it.
That's great.
Um, I have this really good recipe for this, um, pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing
and, um, you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
and my girlfriend and her husband loved it,  in fact she passed it on to her parent
and I was quite impressed with myself if I should say so.
Yeah,
that's how these things sort of make it for one person as an experiment  little bit and little here and there
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm the kind of cook that I don't normally measure things,
I just kind of throw them in
and, you know, I don't to the point of, you know, measuring down to the exact amount that they say.
That means you're a real cook.
Oh, is that what it means.
Uh-huh.
It's real good.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
we have a, we do, uh, uh, middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually,
Uh-huh.
No,
I haven't.
We make, uh, cause we're my wife is Syrian.
Uh-huh.
And, um, her families always have this food she grew up in,
and I've made some of it before as well,
Uh-huh.
so we make, uh, four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple.
Uh-huh.
We put them out for people
and that's always a real big kick for people who want, you know, who've never tried it before.
Uh-huh.
That's , that's, that's, that's a fun idea I mean if you ever, uh, want something different to try.
Uh-huh.
I would try that.
Um, yeah,
I've been wanting to take an, um, oriental cooking class
and I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Oh, do you have a wok though?
Yeah,
Yeah.
I stir fry things on occasion
but I'd like to know more about, you know, more elaborate things like guess.
Uh-huh.
it's easy, um,
and the food just comes out,
you know, if you do it right I think it comes out, the food comes out very tasty not very mushy,
Uh-huh.
you know, and, and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
really.
Yeah,
we, we, we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food,  or Japanese food or, you know,  Korean ,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and that seems to,
so wok food seems to be our thing.
Uh-huh.
So anything else you cook
Um, I just kind of, you know cook here cook there
I don't have any one specialty
I mean I'm always willing to try anything usually.
Well, that's good,
that's always the way to do it.
I think it's, uh, .
And I, I especially like baking and making deserts.
I've taken a cake decorating class
and,
Oh, the Wilson course?
No,
no,
actually it was a private course,  through like a
I like it .
That's great,
I haven't the Wilson class.
It is, it's, it's neat but it takes a long time,
and it's like, you know, you bake the cakes
and then I guess just because I don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it,  like, you know, some, a professional would I try to, I go real slow
Right.
and, you know, it's a little time consuming,
Uh-huh.
but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do.
Yeah,
oh, yeah,
we have, um,
my brother can do it,
Uh-huh.
he's, he's, uh, got a degree in business management
so he learned to, uh, how to do this .
Uh-huh.
Can you hold on one second?
Sure.
Thank you.
Sorry about that.
That's okay
Some one kept beeping in our calling waiting ,
Uh-huh.
so.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
he, he, does that a lot,
So.
so, you know, he cooks a lot  you know, he bakes a lot whenever he,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and he baked us, he made a real big cake himself,
Uh-huh.
It was amazing
I never ,  could do anything with cakes
Uh-huh.
and it's,  it's just horrible.
Well, you learn helpful hints in the classes at least.
Yeah,
I'm,
You know, the instructor told us certain things about well, don't follow what's really necessarily on the box, you know, if you're making just a cake from a box, you know, do this cause, you know, make it a variety.
Oh that, that you mean about the,  mix itself.
You know, some different hints.  Yeah.
Well, that helps.
Some different hints, you know, and the different the different kinds of frostings you can make,
you know, and I have a book an it,
and, you know, all of the different, you know, decorating tips an things like that.
Yeah.
So.
Well, most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they. * to = too
Yeah,
yeah.
Those are, those kill me
it's like, it's like I'm eating sugar,
but they're good sugar.
Well, yeah
I think that's part of the problem,
yeah.
Yeah,
so that's about it.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Okay, well.
It was, it was a pleasure chatting with you.
It was nice talking to you.
Yes,
well, have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Uh, well I mean I've had time to think about it because, uh, we've had,
uh,
there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to
so. So, um, I, I was thinking about a couple things, uh and whether they are serious.
Oh, okay.
Uh-huh.
Some things are serious
and some aren't.
I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is, is, uh
Uh-huh.
not the biggest thing,
but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, uh, situation, that you, uh, that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit, extensive checks and, and things of that nature.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
When, um,
I, I, I mean I, I don't know if that's an invasion of privacy, simply, I, I do I do feel it is
but I don't know whether, some of the questions they ask are legitimate uh, because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
Well what's scary is, uh, uh, about two, three, four months ago on a in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS MORNING NEWS.
Uh-huh.
They showed a reporter and a, um, and a copy editor how they went out
and they just took, um, a fellow in John Q. Public in Dallas
and all they had was,
let's see, they had his they had something like his birth date, the street address,
um, they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name, excuse me,
and it was, um, very scary to see what they found out.
I mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against, you know, two or three houses, through a two divorces, children's names, locations,
um, it was really frightening.
Well I guess, I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact, that once you give your social security number there are people I guess who are, who are, uh, actually collecting all this all the time
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I understand, uh,
I read the other day that, uh, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone uh, all, all they need now is your telephone number, which I guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not.
Uh-huh.
Right,
uh-huh.
I, I, I feel that is an invasion of privacy
but it,
I do too,
yeah.
I don't, the other thing I don't like is, um, in terms of uh,
like we just moved here from, uh, Minneapolis
and, uh, to get the, the very nice townhouse that we're in, you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private
Yeah.
you know, husband and wife, owners, um, who had never done this before.
They, um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information
and what we really didn't have the same opportunity,
you know, and I guess that's when I also get upset that if you're going to do it then I want to do it too.
Yeah,
exactly.
Um, in terms of the credit,
yeah,
I know, um, we're also going through adoption now,
Yeah.
in for an adoption,
and I mean after we gave our fingerprints to the F B I, you, you, look at each other, yeah, you look at each other and say, well, it's too late now.
Um, so I mean it's, it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try, um.
Yeah,
I, I have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me, uh
Uh-huh,
go ahead.
uh, well, by,
uh, I make my living by, uh, flying airplanes for, for a company.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, as a, as a, uh, an airline pilot I have to take random drug testing.
Uh-huh.
I mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time,
so I when I finish a, a certain flight on a random basis I have to, uh, have a a drug test
Uh-huh.
and, and, and that's without uh, probably cause,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, in the end now, I mean they've tested, they've spent forty million dollars
it isn't,
and they've found, uh, I think, uh, in pilots anyway, of something like, uh, uh, eighty-six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up, uh, three guys have come up positive,
and one of them was a bad test,
so.
Positive for anything,
see yeah.
See, uh, and I just started working, well for an electronics firm down here,
I used to be a reporter.
Yeah.
And then now, I'm in corporate communications,
Yeah.
and, uh, part of that excuse me, was, as a new hire, that I had to take a drug test,
Drug test,
and I had never been asked that
and I thought, um, I really didn't like it.
Um, I, I have very mixed feelings about it.
I don't disagree or agree with you.
Yeah.
Um, I think I think that it's well
and you're in that field,
so I don't know,
but it's,
you know, we lived in, uh, Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas,
Yeah,
right.
yeah,
that hit the fan like, uh,
you, uh, you're obviously aware of that, um
Yes,
I am.
I don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of,
if they're going to do random, um,
I, I don't agree with random,
Yeah.
um, I don't see a problem with that.
I do think, I see some level of necessity, um, in something where people are transporting other people, uh, only because of the things you've heard about.
The problem is
the reason I feel that way, even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the, you know, majority, um.
Yeah,
I, I can understand the public's alarm to it,
Yeah,
I'm not alarmed.
but, I guess, having done this all my life, I knew that there wasn't a problem
and, and it, indeed it has proved out that way,
but now, try to get the damn thing repealed, you know.
You can't,
yeah,
I know, it's, um.
I guess I feel bad because,
uh, not only that
but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints, I mean what, what happens if you say no.
If you say no then you're excluded
and I,
doesn't seem the courts,
Right,
right,
it's a matter,
and that's, um, exactly what it is.
Yeah.
I mean, that, that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion.
Um, if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania.
That's right.
I mean, if,
you hate to say that,
but that's the way it is.
It's my feeling also that, that, that although
I, I don't know if it's that serious,
but that was part of the question,
Uh-huh,
I do feel the courts have, have held up a great deal of, of our privacy, I mean particularly look in, in some of the, in some of the,
Uh-huh.
uh, I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy, which I support of course,
Uh-huh.
but it I guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that, it does seem that we've, we've slipped and that's eroded,
or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that, you know, it's fair game,
you, you have to answer these questions, of course.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I don't know,
I, I feel there has been an erosion
and I don't really know how serious it is, except I don't like it
In terms of the privacy, yeah,
that in it,
and also, I agree with that
and in the, in terms of the question, um, in terms, uh,
I worked in medical public relations for almost a decade,
Um.
and that was pre-AIDS and all the other, um, things, that were probably there but just not excuse me, labeled
Um.
and I have a real problem with medical professionals,
um, it goes back to the things like drug screening
but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment,
Uh-huh.
um, and I think this is much stronger than, you know, pilots or, uh, train engineers being screened,
Yeah.
um, the transmission of the AIDS virus, um,
that's a real ethical problem.
I mean I don't, I don't have the answer,
I, I, you know, I mean I think of the young girl in Florida who,
well, yeah
that's,
was she from your part of the country?
Or was she from,
What was that?
The young girl that, uh, contracted AIDS through her dentist, allegedly.
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then they proved it,
yeah.
Right.
I don't, I don't know, um, I don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general, or what, um,
Well I mean it, it,
just take that, that step now, where, where now we feel there's a need to do that
and the next thing you know then, uh, there's always the need to, to go and inspect lockers of high school students,
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah,
the,
I guess the question is, uh,
the, the thing for me is, who sets the parameters or who has the control, you know.
Yeah,
I guess so,
I mean well, uh, good luck to you,
you just moved to Texas from Minneapolis.
Yeah
Uh, I don't, I don't hold out much hope for you.
Yeah.
I think they'll be a cultural shock.
I mean I was based there a lot, uh, several times in the service
and I was absolutely flabbergasted at the,
in, in at least in criminal law some of the, some of the, latitudes that the police had,
Oh it's, it's
but.
I'm, uh,
very seriously,
more than just seriously,
I'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the Fall.
Oh yeah.
And, yeah,
if I figure out that's still what I really want to do
and, the things I'm finding out are the in terms of things like privacy, the way the law is interpreted, presented,
Yeah.
um, it's no better than journalism Um, except in journalism it's words,
um, this is very frightening in that, uh, oh,
and in, uh, in Texas they, they they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents, whether it's domestic or international,
Um.
they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check.
Yet, if you're caught with,
let's just say, um, that somebody who's in
not us,
but somebody who's need of carting, um, aluminum beer cans around,
they haven't touched them,
they haven't drank them,
they picked them up off the street
and they want to take them to a recycling, uh, resource for money, or whatever.
Um, they've, they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again, um, because they've been arresting people like that.
Well, I mean, I don't understand,
You know.
if you, if you don't,
if they don't make a criminal check, why do you have to be fingerprinted.
Because, um, in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level. Because you have to because you have to deal with the I N,
yeah,
because you have to deal with the, uh, immigration service.
Oh, I see,
oh the state doesn't require it.
Well that's kind of, that's rather, that's rather unusual, isn't it.
Yeah
it is,
it's, uh,
the whole thing is,
I mean there's, again there's no consistency.
You know, like in your,
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly, um, I can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval,
or you know, I mean
Well I guess, I guess the extension of that is, why, why not,
the next thing you know, we'll just stop a random amount of motorists
and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street.
They, they do that in Texas.
Oh, they do?
They don't do it for drugs,
what they do is they check to see if you've got, uh, current insurance
or they check to, to see if you're permits are,
Yeah.
Well there's, there's all sorts of scare tactics, I guess, to, to invade our privacy
and,
Yeah,
I know
and it's kind of, um,
what's the word I want,
I don't,
it's
to me it's just frightening, you know.
Yeah.
I mean the old, uh,
I'm old enough now where George Orwell,
uh, way past time
I just going to say, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, is come is come and gone
Yeah.
but it's here.
Yeah,
it's exactly true,
I mean I,
And the computers, of course helps that.
The computer abilities store that information.
Well look at what we're talking now,
I mean, it's,
look how we're talking now,
I mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger, you know,
Well
Well, what kind of music did you all listen to?
Oh, my goodness.
Now see, we think of classic rock that they, you know, have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul.
Uh-huh.
I mean it was,
that is a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles.
I mean we were there.
No,
now, well then you was, in the, uh,
or, I am sorry,
Yeah.
I was,
I am going to make you sound like you're  eighty something.
Well, I was,  I was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out.
Okay,
I was fourteen years old.
Woodstock.
What was,
Woodstock?
yeah,
Well, I wanted to go.
I was in Chicago.
And I guess I was close to eighteen or something.
I, I,
I can't quite remember the year.
And, uh,
You would have had a ball.
Uh, yeah.
I, I kind of liked, would have liked to have been there.
We could not, we could not get it together to drive.
I mean, you know, we had never driven outside of, you know,  ten miles out of town at that time.
Yeah.
And here we were all hep to go to Woodstock, you know.
Don't you wish you had been able to, though?
I really do.
You,
Oh, that would have been such a great memory.
It would have been incredible.
I, I think of, uh, you know, all the, social changes that were going on around that time. And,  and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness. Everything from,
Yeah.
well, I mean, I remember we had the first Earth Day back then, you know,
Yeah.
we got out of school at, at, uh, the university,
and we celebrated Earth Day.
You went and planted a tree or something?
Yeah.
Planted trees and stuff,
and we did not realize, you know, the implications of all that then,  and a lot of the stuff that goes on  today.
Uh-huh.
Well,
when I grew up, it just was not, we did not have any causes.
To me it didn't, doesn't seem like we have got much,
you know what I mean?
You'll,
I mean there there was no name to it.
It was everything that was started in the sixties.
You had, you had to fight for racial equality.
Yeah.
Well, I do remember demonstrations over busing.
And busing
Yeah.
It was like just a continuum.
You know, everything sort of had a seed in the sixties.
Yeah
And women's rights, I mean, things for women were totally different for you by that time.
Yeah.
Well, right.
By the time I was born, even now, you know, women's rights, uh,
we just,
You just assume.
we are totally equal now.
There is not really a lot to fight over.
Now I saw something on T V last night on TWENTY-TWENTY.
You know, men's, uh, fathers or daddies,
now wait a minute,
Daddies Are People Too.
Yeah.
It is about a lot of men, you know, all right, going through divorces.
The judge will usually, uh, give custody to the mother ninety-seven percent of the time. Because they go through the female.
Yeah.
Well, we learned from KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, didn't we?
Something like that.
But it does seem, you know,
It seems unfair.
Yeah.
It really does.
But it,
see men are coming into their own now too.
Yeah.
They are, well,
I thought about that.
I thought well, now men, you know, have to fight to be equal.
And I think that is only right though, really.
He,
one guy said the judge looked at him and said, "Well, now, Mister So and So," he says, "I have never seen, uh, calves follow a bull.
They always follow the heifer."
"That is why I always," he said, "That is why I always give custody to the mama."
And he said, "Well," he said, "does that mean you are going to shoot them if they break a leg and, you know, butcher them if they get fat?"
Yeah.
Well, are you married
and do you have children?
Yeah.
I am married
and I have got two kids.
Two kids.
And, and how does your husband respond to all the new, social, uh, changes?
My husband is not a conformist at all.
He is still back there in the seventies
Well, I mean he is still wearing bell bottoms not bell bottoms but, flared pants. And he,
well I do not like them
They are  going to be back in style any day now.
Yeah.
Any day now
Well, he just, you know, he is, he is his own person.
He,  you know, he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes,
Oh.
but he wears what clothes he wants to. Which we are both that way.
If something is out of style, I do not really care.
If I like it I am going to wear it.
Yeah.
But, uh, my husband is not a conformist at all
Oh.
Well see, that, that is the spirit of the sixties.
And whether we are talking about the rain forests.
Uh-huh.
I tell
you, you know, the situation you have right now
and, and all of our generations is what to do with the children. Because both mother and father have to work now.
Well, uh, we are trying to keep away from that.
My husband works for the railroad.
Oh, okay.
We have got it real tight.
But I have got a four month old baby,
and I do not want to work.
I want to tend to her.
That's, That's, see, that is your commitment.
I want to raise my kids.
Uh-huh.
You do not know what you are changing when you do something like that.
Well,
You do not understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent.
Right.
Well, when he grew up, he grew up with his,
we both grew up with single mothers.
Uh.
And my mom had six kids.
Uh-huh.
So, she had to work.
And, you know, I was raised by my sisters and stuff.
And I can, I can't see the difference.
But I know that it would have been better had Mom been able to stay home with us.
That one person that you could always count on being there.
Right.
Right.
And my husband was the same way.
And we just,
I want to raise my kids.
I do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them.
Well,
I want to be there to make sure that,
well, they need guidance
and they do need parental guidance twenty-four hours a day.
They definitely do.
They definitely do.
I,
Do you stay home with yours?
Uh, well, see, I, if I had some I would.
I, I have not,
I had an unfortunate thing happen,
and I am, you know,
and it is not going to happen that way.
Uh-huh.
But my, my, uh, friends are having babies right and left,
so I get to see the different ways that they,  uh, all raise them.
They raise them.
And, and one gal, she started a business, in her home.
And she, she hired an au pair, which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house.
Well, but see now,
And the guy lives in with her, you know,
Yeah.
I mean, you know, it is a family sort of unit sort of thing
and the,
to Okay, sweetie.
Let mommy talk.
And so,
Well, I think that's neat.
So that is a different way.
And then my other girlfriend just, you know, tears her hair out and goes at it, you know, twenty-four hours a day, watching both kids all the time.
And I think there is a point where you just have to get away.
Right.
And it is good for the kid
and it is good for you to develop, you know, your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time.
Uh-huh.
Well, I know the family is really going through changes.
But now, we are trying to go back to about the sixties, when the parents, you know, when the mother was staying at home.
Yeah.
Unit .
Or that,
what do they call it, the nuclear family?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, uh,
Do you have any, uh,
do you have your mom or anybody around you that  helps you?
Uh,
well, my family is Kentucky.
Now my, one of my sisters is down here.
Yeah.
Her husband happened to get a job at T I
They moved out here,
but
his family lives here
and, my husband was in the service when I met him.
Uh-huh.
And so we, we've been all over
to Okay, Kyle
Then I,
he got a sunburn
and he is itching,
so I am keep having to scratch his back.
Oh.
See, uh, I would love to get a business going out of my home.
Outside of, I mean, going,
Right.
yeah.
Well, that is,
I would rather work at home, if I could.
Well, see and, and that is, uh, the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home.
Yeah.
That is the trend.
Yeah.
They are bringing offices, I mean, I mean big businesses into their home.
Bringing their computers home and working from there.
Right.
And I think, you know, the more we try to, you know, shape that, the more input we, have into what that whole system is going to look like. Because that is, that is our choice now too.
That is,  that is our cause.
Well, I think,  I think one that would be, uh,
it is, uh,
kids could see their parents, you know, how hard they work,
Yeah.
they would understand more.
When, uh, we first moved down here, I was working.
I was working a twelve hour shift,
and it was three and four days a week.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,
Um.
oh, my little boy just, he went wild. You know, I mean because, because he had been used to me being there all the time,
Being there all the time.
yeah.
Yeah.
And he is just now,
well, when I got pregnant, I went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home
and it was costing too much at home, than, more at home than I was bringing in.
So,
Yeah.
See the economic situation on the whole thing.
And then, uh, well it is,
see we do have things that we are concerned about here.
Uh-huh.
This generation,
I don't know.
Social change is always going to go on,
but I think we have taken a big leap in the last, you know, twenty, thirty years.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, nothing is the same.
No,
it seems like it is totally different.
Of course, I do not have much to compare it to.
To me,  our causes do not seem as important as you all's were.
Well.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
But we, we grew, we passed them on to you, you know,
I mean,
You, you what?
I said, "We passed them on to you."
Okay.
We passed them on to us.
I mean, you know, because it takes a lot of hard work.
It takes writing letters to Congressmen and,  and, you know, just being very, very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future.
Uh-huh.
And, and, uh, you know, um, did we make the right choices?
We do not know,
we will never know.
No.
I mean, you know, I, I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today.
Yeah,
I think we made some big wrong choices.
Okay,
yeah.
And I think business got in the way.
I think the greed of the eighties got,
Okay,
well, what's your opinion about capital punishment?
Well, Cathy, I think that, uh, capital punishment certainly has a place in our society, um, maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition.
Right,
I think I would agree with you on that, too.
I, I can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation, uh, keeping them, you know, paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem.
Maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped.
That might be true,
um, I'm,
what I don't know, is where do we draw the line.
Right.
Uh, do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,
or do we extend it beyond that?
Uh-huh,
beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder?
Well, either, you know.
Uh, I have a, a nine year old daughter,
and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes, that, that I would consider basis for murder.
Yeah.
Yeah,
well that really gets into a sticky issue.
Uh, I could see that too.
I think there's probably things I could think of short of murder that someone, I think someone would probably deserve to be killed for.
But, gosh,
and who's going to decide which is how bad, you know,
something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me,
and, uh, it's gets into a pretty sticky issue.
Yes,
it does.
A lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and, um, to what's allowable and where are we.
Right.
Uh, you know, if we were, lived in a different country, then murder is not so bad.
Yeah.
But over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a, a heinous act.
Yeah,
in some eyes.
I think some people give up that
I think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than, than what most people think of them as.
I don't know what, um, Texas's criteria for capital murder is, do, capital punishment is,
do you know?
Are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances?
I don't know.
I believe it's, uh, at the discretion of the judge or jury.
Uh-huh.
I used to live in Virginia,
and I know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only, um, if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder.
Those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which I think is a little too limited.
I tend to agree with you there.
Um, my belief is that, is that, um, any crime that's freely committed, you know
freedom of choice
Uh-huh.
these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life such as rape, deserves punishment by death.
Yeah.
But then I'm also told that I'm a pretty harsh person.
Yeah,
in general terms I'm not so harsh,
but then whenever I hear of a specific case, you know, where someone did something, then it's like, yeah, put it to them
So, I think I probably tend to be a little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes.
Because,
yeah,
I think you're right,
that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,
they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,
just you know,
they ruin someone else's life.
All right,
I can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food than a person who commits a crime to, either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill, the feeling of power that they get from it, or to acquire drugs for some other, I mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity.
Right.
Uh-huh.
You know, that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights,
the, the first guy, you know I just assumed it was a guy, the first person, that went out to rob a store for food, that to me is, is a different set of circumstances, where he, he deserves help instead of, uh, loss of life.
Right.
Yeah,
That's right
or with the,
What about, uh, like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that. Say fifteen, sixteen year old.
Would you consider, uh, capital punishment for them?
I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen.
Uh-huh.
There's some,
and I, I certainly don't know myself,
but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the, the consideration of, of long term consequences begins.
Right.
Yeah,
what age they're accountable, for their actions.
and, uh, well he's nineteen now,
and I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year,
And I have an eleven year old and a nine year old,
and I don't, don't see it in them yet,
but I'm, I'm not sure where it begins.
Yeah,
I know that they are lowering the age of, uh, whatever is considered a minor.
I think the kids, certain kids have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be,
like,
I think I read about a boy that was nine or ten, that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them,
and they were trying to charge him as a,
Okay
so,
First how much television watching do you do?
I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone during the day,
Uh-huh.
and I like it just for the noise
That's right,
but do you actually watch it, pay attention to it
Um.
or is it more of a company?
Um,
it just depends on what it is.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I have my favorite things that I do,
Uh-huh,
okay.
and then some fun thing to do sometime.
Right.
Um, what about you?
Well, actually, I work full time
and when I am not working I am running
and I do not watch a lot of television
and I am very selective in what I watch.
Right.
If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off.
I probably watch television four hours a week, max.
Well see that's great,
yeah.
And, and, uh,
Well,
if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, well, then I just do not turn it on.
I would rather listen to music.
Right.
Part of it is that, uh, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us
and we do not know where that influence came from.
Well, I think that, well, part, I think that's partially true, too.
Yeah.
I think you have to have the will and the,
and, uh, anyway, I think it,
Uh, right,
right,
right.
you are, you would be susceptible to stuff.
Of course, I, uh,
And it has to be reinforced at another level too.
That's
Do you like specials?
Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.
Those are fascinating to me.
Oh.
If I have the opportunity, I watch it.
Unfortunately, I was with someone else who was flipping channels.
Oh
I hate that.
I do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor.
Oh, right,
yeah.
In our comedy programs, although,
nobody can appreciate comedy any more than I can,
but I would prefer to find, a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians.
Well, we have cable also,
Uh-huh.
and sometimes you can, um, get the H B O specials,
and sometimes those are really, pretty hysterical.
Uh-huh.
So, I, I like to watch comedy,
I mean,
Uh-huh.
and that's something.
I, I enjoy comedy.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I, I guess I have my old favorites,
Uh-huh.
Bob Newhart is still on.
Uh-huh.
I watch him.
I enjoy that,
uh-huh.
And, uh, you know, something on that level,
Uh-huh.
I, I also enjoy, uh,
I do not know,
Sunday mornings, it's Channel Thirteen,
I watch a lot, of Thirteen, uh, THE MCLAUGHLIN GROUP,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and I, I just laugh,
That's right.
I mean, I think that's so hysterical, these guys.
Uh-huh
It's just so much fun.
It's just, it's just a lot of fun, watching that.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the, they say,
Right.
Right.
so, yeah,
Well
I like to be entertained,
I really do
Yeah.
I watch it for entertainment,
but I also watch it for, uh, cultural impact.
I do a lot of channel thirteen, channel three, some of the educational channels,
and I watch for special programs that have special, a special play, a special concert, uh,
I recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars.
Oh, now that was fabulous,
Uh, and it was fabulous.
and that, you know,
I was just absolutely,
Yeah.
you just held you breath, in some of those.
Yeah.
and, uh,
Yeah.
oh, I was just,
it makes chills all, over you.
I know.
So,
So,
I, I may or may not even look at the T V guide,
but if I have time I may flip through and say hey this looks good if I finish this task I can watch that in an hour.
Uh, if the hour comes and I do not get a chance to watch it, so what.
You know, well, there's certain
I mean,
Uh-huh.
I have got, um, my T V in the kitchen here
Uh-huh.
I love to watch cooking shows.
I, I really do.
like she is drinking I do too,
it makes me want to cook,
I know
and then I eat,
and then I get fat,
so, I just let other people watch
I, I,
yeah.
then I eat what they cook
And, and there's some, um,
in fact, one of the water color shows, I know, has inspired me to take water color lessons, you know.
Oh, I think that's, marvelous.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah,
I took a lot of my,  college courses,
I took some of my, college courses on television,
Yeah.
so that,
it's very successful for some of, those things,
Oh.
but I think I really got stung very badly about having influence in your life,
or at least I saw a very bad example of having television influence your life, uh,
my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps,
Uh-huh.
and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old woman ever walked.
She got you a
Absolutely,
I do not know who she thought she was,
but she just got to the point where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice, and that attitude being demonstrated.
Yeah.
And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.
Oh, well, see that's,
And,
But she was probably depressed to begin with.
Well, I do not know.
You know what I mean?
Well, she was grumpy to begin with.
Yeah,
grumpy to begin with.
Yeah.
There's no doubt about that,
but, uh, but you could clearly see those influences, and in my youngsters,
Uh-huh.
I know that one day, uh, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES,
and I always thought that was just casual slap stick, comedy,
I hate that show
but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench, I decided that was not funny, any more.
Yeah.
I, I,
And, I really, I really feel very strong about the BART SIMPSON SHOW.
Good.
I think that is,
the kids watch that
and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw.
And I just, I do not like it.
Is not that amazing.
How old are your kids?
like ice against a glass, then drinking Mine are grown,
but I have grandchildren. And, young children around,
Oh, okay,
so that's,
Yeah.
and, uh, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic
I had forgotten about that,
see, it's just my husband and I of the kids shows and all that,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
but, uh, um, I don't know.
Well, I was very careful even when my kids were, kids were at home.
Yeah.
And when they were young I was, really did, uh, watch what they watched.
I was
I sat down with them
and I watched it,
and if I did not like it, I changed the channel for them. You know,
Right.
Right.
I just
And, and you know we get it at school, too,
anyway, so you might as well not, reinforce it you know.
Sure.
That's right,
that's right.
Gosh,
they got, they are mouthy enough anyway.
I know, I remember going to
my parents were a lot like, too
Uh-huh.
kids have, but, all the watch RAWHIDE and all those shows.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, my parents never let me watch anything like that.
I could watch YOGI BEAR, you know,
Uh-huh.
what kind of culture was that
Yeah
well,
And, I remember going to school the next day
and everybody would be asking, oh, did you see that, did you see how he did that
Uh-huh
and did you see,
and I could never participate.
Uh-huh.
And it always made me feel a little bit, you know, a loner
like I, you know,
Sure,
I can, understand how that would happen.
But, uh,
But see, then my parents,
Absolutely,
well, I did,
to, uh,
I ran my kids to death
I said, hey, I think that's enough television for awhile,
Really.
maybe we need to go outside,
Yeah.
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company.
So I would go out with them,
now see there's the problem, parents do not do that.
They, say, you go outside and play,
That's true.
Or, you go rent a video up at, the store and come home and sit down and watch it.
Yeah.
I said,
and we did other things.
And I think that was,
Well that's, you know, that's something people do not do,
well, here we are talking on that subject,
but that's, that's an interesting concept
I have got to stick in my , uh,
Of course,
You know work with kids
but, uh,.
And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something, um.
Yes,
uh-huh.
sure.
Right,
Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?
No.
No,
nor am I.
I avoid them with all
They are a lot of work,
that is for sure.
Yeah,
they are,
I mean I do them,
Yes.
but they are a lot of work.
Yeah.
I usually have them when I, there is a special event in our lives
and I, I make a big deal out of it for them.
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, uh, I think I am most, uh, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.
Yeah.
Right,
yes.
You know, and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust
and, you know, I can make my pies from scratch,
Uh-huh.
I do not need a recipe to follow.
And, uh,
Oh, that's great.
You sound like my mother who has been,
well I bake pies too,
but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family
and she has the same, the same technique,
I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just,  kind of do it second nature.
Yeah,
you just know from heart.
I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie
and she said make me one,
and I made her one.
Uh.
And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody".
And I thought whoa, that was a big pie.
She enjoyed it, huh
Yes
Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we had a, a, an auction one time at the church
excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars
My word,
she must have a great pie recipe then.
Well, I think I, I have had it once
and it has been a few years ago,
but I do recall that it was quite good,
so, uh,
Wonderful.
Yeah.
So, that is her specialty, uh,
I like to bake, uh, also,
I do not bake so much now that my children are grown,
but I do enjoy baking
and I guess I always liked making, uh, cookies and bars and things like that,
Huh, uh, would you, I mean, if you had children, would you want them to go to a certain place
or,
Um, I would want them to make that decision
and I would, you know,
Yeah.
uh, I pretty much made my decision on my own and my older brother, likewise.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, you know, we, we were both pretty much happy with what we did.
Yeah.
So, I think, I would not push them towards any one place.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I know,
I kind of feel the same way
I, I just finished college a couple years ago
and I, uh, you know,
it was while I had my family and everything and it was a lot harder,
but, uh, you know, I went to a college that was fairly local
and I feel like my education, you know,
you get out of it what you put into it, I think.
Uh-huh.
But, you know, I know,
it's,
some people are real adamant about, you know, going to a certain school or whatever.
Uh-huh.
I do not know,
I guess it, a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something,
I do not know.
But,
Yeah,
exactly.
But,
I think one of the first things kids ought to look for is, first of all, they have to decide what they want to major in. And then, you know, find a school that's good for that.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Is that why you picked the school you did
or,
Well I picked it for a couple of reasons, it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home, so it was far enough away that I was away, but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home, I could.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you lived there at school then?
You lived there at school.
Yeah,
I lived up at school.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh, another reason was, uh, I paid for my entire education. So I had to look for something that I could afford economically.
Uh-huh.
Right.
You know, and, uh, Clarion was, oh, it was roughly around six thousand a year.
Uh-huh.
And that was for tuition
and,
Yeah,
that was for everything.
And now, I did not go out a lot
and I did not order out a lot,
Uh-huh.
and I, you know, I did not spend money on myself.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, then again, I was there for school
so,
Yeah.
Uh, and then another reason was I was not sure, you know,
I always wanted to go to school for nursing, and then at the last minute, I changed my mind.
Uh-huh.
And I knew that Clarion was known, you know, for two things,
actually, for their,
they are known as a teacher's school and also for their business.
Uh-huh.
So, that's what I ended up going for is for business.
For business.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, are you working somewhere then
or,
No,
no
not yet,
I am moving shortly,
so I am not looking around here.
Oh, I see,
where are you going to move to?
Uh, Maryland.
Oh, are you?
Uh-huh.
Do you have friends there
or,
My fiancee is down there
Oh, I see.
So, does he work for a company down there?
Yeah,
he works for the government.
Oh, I see.
Oh, the big company.
Yeah
So, yeah,
I, I have been working for T I for about twelve years, I guess.
So,
Uh-huh.
But I am not originally, I am originally from Illinois, but, you know, I have gone to college, I guess a few different places,
but I think, you know, for the most part, you know, the teachers have been pretty good and I have got out of it what I have, what I have put into it.
Uh-huh.
So, but, you know, I think, I think that's most of it personally,
but that's why I, you know, with my kids, I think that, you know, I am just going to encourage them to go.
And I am going to try to help them financially
but, uh, I think, you know, financially, I am,
there's only so much I can do for them,
Exactly.
and I will say, here's what you have got,
you can either, you know, go a couple of years locally and, you know, then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then, we might be able to handle it. But, otherwise, you can just go for four years, you know, somewhere and I will try to, try to help you. But, uh, I do not know, you know, the financial end of it, like you said.
Uh-huh.
I put my wife through school too.
Of course T I paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff, but, uh, it still was a challenge to do.
And, uh, so, I think, you know, financially that's, that's one of the big aspects.
Exactly,
yeah.
You know, you,
It does have a lot of bearing on it, whether you are paying for yourself, or whether your parents are, you know.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, did you, uh, since you were paid for school yourself, do you think you had a different outlook on it, like your grades and things like that?
Uh, yeah,
because I was paying for it myself, I kind of slacked off,
because I felt it was mine and I could do with it what I wanted.
Uh-huh.
I think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me, you know,
Uh-huh.
uh, they pretty much got to the point,
well, well, you know, you are at that age
and you are going to have to decide what you want to do.
If you goof, up, it's your fault,
Right.
it's not ours, you know.
Right.
And then, lets me go
and, I mean, I did not do poorly.
I finished with a two five,
that's not that wonderful either.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
But, uh, you know, I, I mean I worked,
I did not, you know, goof around,
Yeah.
I worked.
Right.
It was just harder, you know,
I do not know,
I was used to being, you know, on top
and when I started there, it was like, you are mediocre,
so.
Yeah.
Well see, I think, you know,
I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it
and, and I guess it depends on the way you are raised too,
but if you, if you grow to expect that, you know, you kind of go there as sort of a vacation, you know,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I,
that's the way a lot of my friends did it
and, you know, they were not, they did not take it very serious.
I know I took it real serious,
'cause I did not start to college until, you know, I was about eight or ten years and, uh, you know, out of what I should have been in school.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, you know, so I think that helped me be real serious about it.
And I, I ended up graduating with like a three point six.
Oh, wow,
that's really good.
Yeah,
so I, you know,
and that was hard cause I had two kids, and, you know, a family and everything else,
Uh-huh.
so I had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time.
But,
Yeah.
See, well I screwed myself up also,
there was a point in time that I decided that I did not want to in school,
and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said, what are you going to do
and I said, well I am going to go because I have not whipping butter the rest of my life, you know.
Yeah,
you are right,
exactly.
So, I went and I just took business,
Uh-huh.
well, being as I was paying for it myself, you know, I just kept,
you do not get into your major until like your second or third year.
Right.
And I am going into my third year
and I decided, well I do not want to do accounting anymore,
right
Uh-huh.
and I thought, oh, my God, I am paying for this myself,
I am not switching completely because, I will put myself a year behind.
Right.
Yeah.
So I switched to finance,
and I liked it better
and I pulled myself from a two oh to a two five, you know, in my last year, my senior year.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But I would have really liked to go on, uh, secondary ed with math education,
Uh-huh.
but it was just the fact I was paying for it myself,
I was not going, to put myself behind another year.
Right.
Right.
Well my wife, was sort of in the same situation,
she was, she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go, for,
Uh-huh.
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it.
Uh-huh.
But, you know, by then she had practically got her degree,
so,
Exactly.
so, you know,
I think if, uh, I would have went with the math, I think I would have done a lot better, because I was more interested.
Uh-huh.
And that's what I, I knew that's what I wanted.
But, uh, I think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two,
Uh-huh.
oh, my gosh,
I would like to see the results on a study done.
I think they would do a lot better. Because they are more focused.
Yeah.
They know exactly what they want to do.
Yeah,
I think, I think you are right,
when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say, man I really need this.
Okay,
the topic of the conversation is national health insurance, and the pros and cons, and do I, do we think that the government should finance it.
What is your opinion?
I say yes.
You say yes.
Yes.
Mother lives in Florida,
and there are, in her subdivision there are fifty percent Canadians who won't give up their Canadian citizenship because of the health insurance.
I have heard someone else, uh, say that, uh, the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent
It's wonderful.
and one of the ways that they're financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes.
Oh,
This is evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many, uh, benefits on like lung cancer and things like this.
Well,
Well, even if that's
so, you know, really when you look at it, they have full coverage,
they have H M O, which, you know, after you get used to it, it's not too bad,
and, uh, everything is covered
Yeah,
we,
and we have so many people in the United States that we spend,
well, in my family alone, we spent four thousand dollars in July on medical bills
Oh, my word, Lynn.
insurance didn't cover a penny.
Yeah.
That's horrible.
Yes,
it is horrible.
Well, we're fortunate in that we, so far, knock on wood, most of us have been real healthy
Yeah,
but,
so we don't have a lot of medical bills.
Uh, if you're healthy it's fine,
but I had two kids in the hospital in July.
Yeah,
but what worries me is the fact that I don't like the government telling me who I can see and who I can't see.
Yeah,
but, you know, Richardson School District has the H M O
Uh-huh.
and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list.
Are they?
Yeah.
Well, I know that James had it.
McCullum is.
I beg your pardon.
McCullum is.
Yeah,
yeah.
I know that when James was with Continental Steel, McCullum was part of that,
and, and that's good.
But I also heard, for instance, like, uh, my friend's daughter was on it through Texas Instruments,
and she was on that Kaiser Permanente
Uh-huh.
and they had screwed up her appointment,
and when she went in, she had to take whichever doctor was available,
and they,
she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted.
Well, but that's that's a screw up in an appointment, you know,
But then again, I guess you can even do that in McCullum.
I'm going back to the days when I was pregnant
Uh-huh.
and I had two doctors,
and one was my favorite, personality wise
Uh-huh.
but when I delivered Ronnie, he was not on call
Uh-huh.
the other guy delivered him
Well, that's true,
and that still goes on.
you know, and that,
and, you know, if, um, I go to Townsend
Uh-huh.
he's got a new partner.
I go to both of them now.
You know, I have no choice because when I want to go, if Dr. Howe or whatever his name is is on duty, I go to him.
Right.
Well, you know, it, uh,
how do you think we're going to pay for it?
More and more taxes?
Well, no,
we need to cut some of our spendings, cut some of the fat off the top and whittle it down to the rest of us.
I know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses.
No.
They don't pay anything on, uh, implants or transplants,
No.
and, you know, people are needing these,
and the average person can't afford, you know, a heart or a kidney on just their own.
Yeah.
But you known, Ronnie, in Austin, went to a program and went to a social worker
Uh-huh.
and at the same token there is something,
because he can get his pills for two dollars, when I'm paying fifteen on my medical insurance
Good grief.
and he can get free medical care, but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing David and so again, you know,
Uh-huh.
we went through it, Ronnie's home tonight,
and we talked about it and said, you know, is it worth it?
Yeah,
you know, he pays forty-five dollars a month for his prescriptions, where he could pay six dollars.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, there are programs, you know, if you get on Medicare or Medicaid or one of those,
Very true.
Well, I know they have the Medicaid, you know, for those that have trouble,
and I know that like we have the, uh, prescription cards which,
that's helped bunches
Yeah.
and, wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health,
or wonder if they're wanting it.
That's what I read.
That they are wanting,
I've, uh,
are you there?
Yes, sir,
I'm right here.
All right
Okay, um,
I'm in an area where, um, we can, uh, enjoy it year round,
so, I've actually been, uh, uh, been out within the past couple of weeks.
I'm mainly a freshwater fisherman.
How about yourself?
Well, actually I've done both kinds
Uh-huh.
uh, I'm originally from the State of Virginia and, uh, lived near, near Virginia Beach where we could, uh, surf cast and, uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there.
Uh-huh.
Did you Did you ever do the James River?
I don't believe I have fished the James River.
There's a possibility, but that was so long ago
Uh-huh.
I moved here to, to State College, uh, in nineteen fifty-five
Uh-huh.
and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water
Uh-huh.
and we have a lot of, uh, beautiful fresh water streams that come through this area.
I'm in an area called Center County, which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania,
I've I've been in that area
and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary.
The trout fishing is really, uh, beautiful.
As I say, the, the streams are, oh, eight, ten, fifteen feet wide and so forth,
and, uh, you, you stand on the edge and you, you cast out and you, you work, uh, from your feet most of the time
Uh-huh,
for brookies.
and then there are, there are a few lakes of course, close
Yeah,
what do you like, brookies or, uh, rainbows
or,
I,
wherever the area,
whatever the fish is the specialist in that area, I, uh, I enjoy fishing for it,
and I try to,
I haven't fished in several years I'll have to admit, but when I do fish, I do contact, uh, some of the local specialists so that I can then find out the, uh, the type of lures that they use and where they fish, and any unique, uh, techniques that would help you.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?
Uh, no,
we, we fly fish.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I used to do that a little when I lived up in New York,
but right now it's, uh, uh, bass and striped bass is the only thing that I go for down in in, uh, Texas.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's a pretty big fish.
Uh, yeah,
they're, they've, uh,
the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes,
and they're pretty exciting when they're, when they're running.
Uh-huh.
It's a salt water fish in fresh water, uh, environment.
Well, our, our streams here are replanted with fish about every year so that, well, they, they, they, uh, they have a pretty good idea of, of, uh, what the number of fish are in these various locations,
It's all put and take.
and and they have have certain areas that they plant, you know, a hundred here and a hundred there,
Uh-huh.
and this is, of course, X number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
so,
What's the season?
April to October or something like that?
That sounds about right
Uh-huh.
uh-huh,
pretty close.
Uh
You know.
what's a license cost?
Well, as I say, it's been several years,
but the licenses weren't that expensive,
I,
seems to stick in my mind, five to seven dollars is about all, from what I remember it.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
It's about the same as Texas.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And I have, oh, probably a half a dozen different kinds of, uh, fishing poles and, and fly rods and so forth,
and, and I had been so busy in my work in these last few years that I haven't had time to fish.
But I'm going to be retiring at the end of December,
and I, I hope, uh, the next fishing season, that I can sort of get back in and, uh, enjoy that.
That, that was a really enjoyable, uh, thing for me to do.
Well, I have all sons, so I think I'm probably going to be fishing for a long time
Huh, I just have one son and he, he lives out of the state now, rather, in the eastern corner of it,
so, I don't think he has time to fish either
I caught the disease from my father,
and I'm passing it on to my children.
It's really
Oh, is that right?
They love it,
yeah.
Oh, my goodness.
Right.
Well, I, I, the disease I caught was simply because, uh, I, I was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area,
and people there,
Uh-huh.
there's, there's so much water around that, you, you're either boating or you're fishing
Right.
Right.
and, uh, I fairly enjoyed at that time.
I have a small aluminum boat here that, uh,
Uh-huh.
when I go on one of the large lakes that we have here that I enjoy fishing for, for trout from that,
Uh, uh, I don't, I don't know about the lakes in central Pennsylvania.
Are there many?
Well, as I say, I'm in Center County.
There's, um, there're two different size lakes about, well, five, six miles from State College.
Uh-huh.
Now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view
Uh-huh.
but they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe which, which here is a lot of water,
Uh-huh.
Okay,
do, do you have a home, or apartment?
Uh-huh,
I have a home.
Okay,
do you have to do a lot of upkeep?
Not really,
we have a small backyard and small front yard
Uh-huh.
but, uh, uh, I do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy
That's another story.
Okay
And, uh, and, uh, I do the edging and stuff like that,
but, uh, it doesn't take us that long because our, our yard is so small.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I try and do as much, you know flowering as I can, and that kind of stuff. The seasonal things.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
But, uh, I think we have one of the nicest yards in the, in the neighborhood
Well, that's nice
I wish I could say that.
Ours is pretty small, too,
but it, it takes about an hour with the two of us working to, you know, do the bushes and all of that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, the worst part is controlling the weeds. Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and, because, like, we have a dog and, and, you know, he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there.
Oh, yeah.
That's true.
But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.
Uh um, what else.
I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that, sort of thing
I don't
No?
No,
he does that.
Oh, okay.
Well, if they, if they go up
like, one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and I I went up on the roof once and I'll never do it again
I decided I was afraid
Yeah.
Don't blame you
So this year, he got lazy so I said, fine
I'll put some on the bushes.
And that's about it,
that's all it gets.
Yeah.
Huh, okay,
we don't have that many bushes to put them on.
Uh, our, our yard is very, uh, narrow
Uh-huh.
and so we have some bushes, but we don't have too many,
but we have a nice tree in the front
and uh, we have people that, an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard
Uh-huh.
Oh, wow.
and, uh, they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower.
Oh, no.
You know, every time you do that, it, uh, kind of kills the tree for a while.
Yeah.
And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.
Oh.
And we started mowing our own lawn
Uh-huh.
because they were doing that.
And so, anyways I have a nice full tree now
and, and we put , we fill it with lights and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So,
Um. But you still have to pay for it, though, even though they're not going to do it?
And they would, uh, they also edged,
when they would edge in, into the shrubbery and oh, gosh, it was getting really bad,
so we,
Yeah,
because it's an association fee.
Oh, is it real expensive?
Yes
Oh, gosh.
it's like seventy a month.
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah,
and I don't like,
I, I just get really upset every time I make that check out.
Yeah.
But, uh,
Well, do, do they do other things for you all?
They take care of the, uh, landscape,
because we live in a cul-de-sac
and there is a island in the middle
Uh-huh.
so they care of that
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool
Uh-huh.
and, and there is a pond,
they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so you're basically paying, oh,
and the sprinkler system that,
that
our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does
and, uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems
Uh-huh.
and and so that way if someone moves out, the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing, you know.
Uh-huh.
Um.
So,
But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?
Well, it, it, it went up what we pay.
Oh
And that's the bad thing.
I just hope it doesn't go up any more
because we just can't afford it anymore.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do if you can't afford it
I don't know either.
That's interesting.
So, uh, but, they're,
that's what they do.
They take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it.
Uh-huh.
Now do at a
do things like plant bushes and trees?
They,
only in, like, in the common areas and in the island.
Oh, okay.
But they don't do it in your yard.
So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that?
Right,
uh-huh,
yeah,
so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had.
I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.
I know.
And put new ones out front.
But that was a lot of work.
Yeah.
Took me a long time.
Yeah,
that's what we did when we first moved in, too.
Uh-huh.
Just rearranged some things
Yeah,
and then, then we put in a sprinkler system,
and, We won't go through that again,
Oh.
I will pay someone to do it
Oh, really?
Oh, it took so long.
Oh.
Because my husband was, you know, digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher, you know,
there is a machine that will do it.
Oh, yeah.
Because, you know, there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it.
And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.
Oh.
That's true,
so gosh,
you did it manually.
By hand.
Oh.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah,
but it works great now that we've got it.
I bet.
Yeah,
it's nice.
Yeah,
that's a good investment there.
Yeah,
well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble,
you know, you have to keep the, the area moist around the house or it makes it worse,
Oh.
so, we had an incentive there to do that.
Oh.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Well, uh, a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the, uh, in the space station program
so I get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there
Oh.
and  it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Uh, they're, they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things.
Uh, I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads.
And that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including, uh, some new pharmaceutical techniques.
Oh, you're kidding.
Yeah.
So, you know, there's  there's a big opportunity for us to explore, uh, what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment.
Huh.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
So. I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that.
Oh, that's good because sometimes I wonder, you know, being a, uh, lay person out there of not, uh, knowing exactly what's going on in space. Whether, you know, they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not
we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here.
Being, you know,
to me, all this, uh, space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth. That, uh, we can't live on Mars.
We can't live here,
we can't live there.
I mean, this is the, the place that we have to live.
I mean, there's, uh, no other resource for us to, to look at other than here.
So, it's kind of like, to me,
I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space
and what, you know,
not that I want everything to halt
and let's forget about the space program or whatever,
because we're always curious
and we always need to know more things.
But, uh, to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here.
Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here.
Mainly because, uh,
the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us.
I mean this is it.
I mean if we would have, uh, if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable, uh, planet, we probably would have inhabited it
and, uh, you know, who would have cared about earth?
It would have been another planet to kind of take over and, uh, continue on.
So, you know, and that
when I look at the space program itself, I think of it, you know, as being in terms of it's, it's interesting to learn but it's also, it's, it brings down the fact that this earth is it.
It's it for us, you know what I mean? Uh, unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever.
Right.
But I would love to, uh, go into the space shuttle some day and, uh, just see, uh, you know, the earth and the different planets and things like that.
I, I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know.
Well, uh, as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between, you know, deep space I'm sorry, deep space exploration and, uh, and not doing anything because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Exactly.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, you know, perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that, uh, we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment.
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
Yeah,
that's true, you know.
And I, I think of, uh,
I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert.
Uh-huh.
Uh, there's, uh, you know, they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create, you know, an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it
and then they have an area that's more, uh, you know, full of, uh, vegetation, tropicals, that kind of thing, to kind of look at things and say, you know, the environment wise, this is where we're living
but what, what effects it
and how can we improve it and things like that.
And I, I think in space, uh,
I don't know how many people could live up in space, uh, for any length of time
I mean just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out
and it's cloudy for days
and we don't see the sun
and the people, their moods are extreme, you know.
Right.
It's like, God if I don't get to see the sun I'm going to be in this bad mood all this entire time
and this is how I see people reacting.
You know, when is the sun going to come out?
So I wonder how, you know, somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun You know, in the aspect that we see it. Uh, and never seeing, uh, you know, light, bright days, you know.
Right.
And,
Well, do you have any, uh, television programs that you watch regularly?
Oh, this is kind of tough.
I don't too often watch, you know, shows that are on, on a regular bases.
Uh-huh.
I don't have a lot of time
and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth.
I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value.
No.
But, uh, oh, I watch things like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES, every week.
Uh-huh.
Uh, ugh,
it's kind of tough to think of some of the others. Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.
Uh, like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch, uh, KNOTS LANDING
Oh, you will?
Yeah,
just something like that for, you know, uh, end of the evening type of thing,
Relax.
but, uh. How about you?
Well, I watch, um,
I like news programs, like you mentioned,
and sometimes I will watch, um, like the cable news, network evening news program.
Yeah,
I don't get that so I don't have, that choice.
Yeah,
I, I like that.
I, I watch that a couple of times a week, um,
it comes on like at nine o'clock, at night
Uh-huh.
and I really don't have any like situation comedies that I watch regularly.
I, I have seen that, um, MURPHY BROWN that comes on, Monday nights before
Uh-huh.
and it's kind of cute,
Yeah.
and, but I don't,
But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,
Uh-huh.
uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, uh, military, uh, fellow.
Oh, but,
I mean he's playing a military part.
He's the husband of, the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I know who you're talking about.
I haven't, I have seen it, I think, maybe once.
Yeah,
you know, it it was on one time when I saw it
and, you know, it, it's pretty cute.
I like that
Well, I, um, I,
we really don't watch too many programs regularly.
My children like some of the morning children's shows, when they're home.
Yeah.
They, um,
I just have one son who's in kindergarten
so in the morning they will like to watch like, um, EUREKA'S CASTLE, it's called.
It's just like a SESAME STREET, show,
Uh-huh.
but and they watch a couple of shows like that,
but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.
Yeah,
no
I don't,
And, uh,
I guess, uh, there's some, uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly.
Uh-huh.
On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh,
and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time.
But, uh, they have programs on, uh, house repairs and, how to build things
Uh-huh.
Um.
and, um, they have a calligraphy show,
and I do calligraphy, so, I watch that.
Oh, that's nice.
And, um, they have a lot of cooking shows,
Uh-huh.
And, oh, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those.
I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something,
and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.
That sounds like a good idea.
I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V,
and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,
Uh-huh.
and I record some.
And then, uh, we have just totally cut down,
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then, and watch and then record over it, something else.
Yeah.
And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.
Yeah,
we do some of that,
In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V, than, you know, other kinds of things.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies, that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah,
those are pretty good
I, I like those old ones, much better than some of the new stuff.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And so we, we have really enjoyed that
and it's really nice not to be running out.
Some of the video rentals can be expensive
and,
Yeah.
And, boy,
the movie can be unbelievable.
Uh-huh,
right.
Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.
So we,
I have,
and it's so convenient at home
and you can do it anytime you take the notion.
Yeah.
And so, I have really enjoyed that
but, but there are,
I do have friends that watch programs
like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.
They have some programs that they won't miss.
Uh-huh,
I'm not that hung up to most things.
I mean if I miss something big deal
Yes.
Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again,
Yeah.
That's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.
Pretty funny.
Yeah.
But, uh, T V is something that we try to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it, like you say.
Yeah.
We do too.
Too many other things to do and too much going on.
Uh-huh.
And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your, spare time.
Right.
Right.
I agree.
So it's a little bit, something that we try doing
and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.
Uh-huh.
And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational
but still you want them to go out and do other things.
Even if they're, good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.
Right.
Yeah.
Anyway. Well,
Okay.
Well, we probably exhausted that, huh?
Yeah,
That was pretty good
I, I like that
and, um, I guess it's time to go.
Okay.
I enjoyed talking to you.
Yes.
Nice to have spoken with you, too.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Okay, um,
what do you think about the war recently?
The war?
Uh-huh.
You mean in terms of the economy
or,
Uh, the economy,
the,
our soldiers going over, uh,
Oh,
just everything.
I thought we were going to talk about social changes.
Is that, is that what
you're kind, of directing it,
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh okay
Yeah,
Okay
well Um. Well, I think it's caused a lot of, you know, big difference between when people had gone to war before, like compared to Vietnam
that's the first thing I thought of
I don't know.
Right.
because, I mean, I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over,
Right.
and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that, you know, and support the soldiers,
Right
and,
so.
I know that, uh, I've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two
you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war,
Yeah.
but then in Vietnam that was totally different, you know,
you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably.
Yeah,
And now, if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a, a good candidate. exactly, exactly.
yeah.
Yes,
it would be like a bonus for your, image or something.
Yeah
it,
I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income, just drastically altered.
Oh, torn apart.
Oh,
We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a, just had a new baby,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, they would have, she would have had to go back to work
and, I think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds.
Right.
So it,
that's also a good reason why it, it,
or good that it ended as soon as it did.
Yeah,
yeah.
I think the biggest change that we've seen, um, in, in my life or whatever lately is the economy,
Uh-huh.
and things are so tight,
and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years
and, you know.
Exactly,
and it seems like everything is raising, everything that can be, cigarettes, not that I smoke, but cigarettes, um, uh, stamps,
Yeah.
I mean it seems like
Even dog licenses
I mean,
Exactly,
everything single thing that we do, is higher,
Yeah.
Yeah.
you know. And they just raised the minimum wage today
but that's not like, you know, as much as they should have raised it I'm sure.
Going to effect too many,
Yeah,
yeah.
But, uh,
So, that's the hardest thing for us
and, um, we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home.
We have a three year old and a two year old
and I'm trying to stay home as long as I can,
Right.
but, you know, every week it gets harder
because I could go out and be making money,
Right.
Right.
you know, so that's a big, uh, stress I think, you know, for the social changes in our family.
Yeah.
I don't, I don't have any children or anything right now
I'm, uh, I work as a news reporter in Waco,
Oh,
and so,
I see.
I get to see,
I got to see a lot of not firsthand but, uh, probably a good part of the war, um, as far as what people thought about it, and a lot of things like that,
Uh-huh.
so.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well
It was kind of amazing
people were coming to me to ask me, you know, what's going on, you know, like I knew, or like I sat in on the meetings or something.
Yeah,
you have an inside track or something.
Yeah,
yeah.
So, I got to hear a lot of what the people thought about, you know, changes in, in the war and everything,
so that was pretty interesting.
Yeah,
yeah.
Let's see,
what other social changes in the past ten years, oh,
I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes, in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career, be mom, be, everything, superperson
Yeah.
Exactly,
be everything, be supermom,
Yeah,
because I know, you know, I, I really get pressure from, because I have a career also,
and I get a lot of pressure from people that, you know, my colleagues
that
why am I staying home. You know,
Right.
And,
whereas before that never would have happened
Whereas it would have been,
people would have said, why are you going to work.
Exactly, um.
So, that's kind of a difference for us.
I think there's more pressure to, um, not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family.
Right.
So he's,
The roles are changing a lot.
Yeah,
he's gotten a lot, uh, you know,
you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all,
but in terms of his amount of hours at work, nothing on that has lightened up.
Right.
So, it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer
and,
And even, you know, I think a lot of the movies we see now kind of, kind of play a good part in our changes
because, you see that they have THE THREE MEN AND A BABY type movies.
Yeah,
that's true,
And I think, you know that,
MISTER MOM
and,
yeah,
and then you have the women, uh, detectives now and, you know, different roles,
Uh-huh.
just in what we see
and so we probably want to do that even more now. You know since the women's movement in the, seventies,
Yeah,
yeah.
That's true.
and, you know, we've come a long way but I think it's still a, still have a good ways to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
I think there's still,
I, I know that, um, I grew up in Chicago in the sixties,
Uh-huh.
and was part,
my family was real liberal,
and I think there's a lot of, um, kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society, and race relations and things like that,
Right.
and, you know, I think there's so much prejudice still there,
Yeah.
and it's kind of more covert now.
People used to be more clear and say, you know, well, I believe in this or I believe in that,
Exactly.
Exactly.
and now, you know, I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice,
It's just not as,
but people think, oh, we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that, you know
Exactly.
But it's,
I mean like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, I mean, twice as far to go, still,
Yeah,
yeah.
and I don't think a lot of people, you know, realize a lot, the plight of a lot of people. You know, and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you,  but there's so many more people,  and that you don't even see or know about.
Yeah.
But there's so many more people,  that are homeless
and,
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community,
Oh, oh, yeah.
you know, because when I was growing up in Chicago, um, we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
and there were people from all, first generation Chinese, German, you know all different nationalities, and everything.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And now we're kind of like in Lewisville, Miss White Little suburbia, you know.
Yeah.
I mean I don't even know anybody that you know , from any place other than Texas hardly, you know.
Yeah.
I grew up in, in Brooklyn, New York,
Oh, boy.
and so I was just, I was just surrounded, you know, by Black people,
Yeah.
because I'm Black,
and so, you know I lived, that's where I lived.
Yeah.
And so now, I, I feel lucky actually because I've almost lived around everyone.
I've, I went to U T to college,
Oh.
and so they, you know, they have a lot of different people go there, different kinds of people.
Yeah.
And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see,
Yeah.
you know, some people have lived in Lewisville all their life, you know,   and so they don't get to see,
Yeah,
and they,   they think the whole world, is like that.
Exactly And
We lived in a dorm.
My husband and I met in graduate school, at Indiana University
Uh-huh.
and I was, ours was, uh, international you know, co-ed dorm,
Uh-huh.
and there were twelve hundred students,
they're graduate students from all over the world.
And once we came here it was like,
gosh,
I just miss that,
Exactly.
because it really is exciting, to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds.
It is.
We got invited to,
one guy practically roasted a goat in his, in his dorm
Oh, my God.
I wonder if he was from, Iran, or some place,
I don't know where
Well, there's so many people who have never, you know, even gotten to do that,
so that's great.
yeah.
My sister was telling me she met a she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in, in Philadelphia,
Oh, uh-huh.
and, uh, she just met a girl from, um, I think, Barbados or Jamaica, or something, like that.
Oh.
And I mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time, and everything
Yeah,
and, she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars.
yeah.
So my sister had to take her shopping and, you know, show her what to wear, show her how to match up colors
and, I just thought that was so very exciting, you know, to go and, and just witness, you know, this girl just coming to America type thing, you know.
Oh, God.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
really
So, you know, I would have loved it, the opportunity to do that,
That is part, of the change I think that I've seen probably, you know, in the past twenty years or whatever, is now kids have to have so much.
but,
I mean I even get caught up in it with our kids, even though I buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas,
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
I mean, people you know think they're kids have to have five, hundred dollars worth of toys.
the latest cereal about, you know,
Oh, yeah,
it's just,
Yeah,
that's ridiculous, too.
it, it's,
When I first moved here I was only thirteen but, everyone had a car in school, you know,
Oh, gosh.
and I couldn't, and I just couldn't you know,
I was from New York and so, you know, we road the bus.
Yeah,
me too,
And if you had a
in Chicago I didn't even date a guy that had a car until I was in college
Yeah.
Exactly.
And if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway
or, you know, it's just,
you just didn't have a car,
Yeah.
but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools
and I couldn't understand it.
Yeah.
You know, all the kids had cars,
Yeah.
and they, you know, have to have a car.
Oh, gosh,
So that was,
my kids are going to be hating me,
I'll give them a bike and say, here's it
Yeah
yeah,
right.
so you can afford to pay the insurance, you know
Really.
Or live really close to school and have them walk.
Yeah,
no, kidding.
But,
uh, yeah,
a lot of changes.
Yeah.
So,
Well did we cover it everything Betty
I think so
Okay.
I guess I'll get back to my laundry
Okay,
well, it's good, it's good talking to you.
You too,
good luck.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Well, we haven't really heard that much in the news lately, about, uh, U S involvement in Latin America, since, uh, all this Middle East crisis began.
So I haven't really paid that much attention like, since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on, uh, Iraq,
and, the, so the last thing that I remember hearing that much about is the Iran Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency.
Can you think of anything else that's happened recently?
No,
I would agree with you.
We haven't had too much,
but, uh, historically, we've always, uh, almost been like a big brother to, in, and to the Latin American area, and, uh, almost used them,
I, I, I feel.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think something will have to be done down there very soon about, uh, about Mexico and, and, uh, some of the other areas,
but, but, with the Persian Gulf, as you said, it's just, uh, been very quiet.
I, I keep pretty close tabs on the paper
and you don't hardly see a,
unless it's there and we're just not seeing it.
Well, the only, uh, references that I have seen lately has been, uh, in, part of
the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things,
and, and they made references to in the past, how we have given arms to, uh, Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America, and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.
Uh-huh.
Well that's,
I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq,
but that,
Uh-huh.
whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then, uh, and then it turn around and,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world,
and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there,
and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.
Uh-huh.
And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us,
it seems to come in cycles.
Uh-huh.
And I know when I spent,
the time that I've studied in Mexico, uh, Spanish was one of my majors in college, that, uh, there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America,
Uh-huh.
about, uh, like you say, using them,
our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,
Right.
and that we weren't normally very interested in them,
and they have,
in other, in most Latin American countries, they, there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know,
that they have corruption,
and, and they don't have, uh,
I mean, there's just very few really modern cities.
Right,
and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,
Uh-huh.
and their economy is,
of several of the countries,
especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable.
It's just a, you know, such a small amount,
and it
it just,
it, uh, cuts off just a trickle,
and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where,
that will be another big problem.
Well, that's right,
because that's just so much of the way that they make their money
and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming
Right,
right.
And they don't look at it so much as, you know,
And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh, this is the market.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.
And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different, from the from South America, and Central America.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
There's really a disparity between the, uh, what a I would call civilization of the countries, you know.
we're just so much wealthier,
and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,
Uh-huh.
and that's where, uh, leaders can use, uh, use that whenever the opportune moment arises.
Yes,
it's really kind of sad, and, that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, uh, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and, and when we have, when we have a lot of problems, right in our own back door.
Yeah.
That's right.
Our own hemisphere,
but we've,
that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.
Um.
So, uh,
So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.
Very much so, except when we need them.
You know when they found oil in Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.
recently
Yeah.
Yeah,
fairly recently.
Well, that's really sad.
I hadn't thought about that in a long time.
Um.
Well, I guess then, I will go,
but I,
Okay.
made me stop and think a minute about, not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis.
Sure did.
I know that it's not settled but, there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.
Always,
yes ma'am.
Well, thank you,
you have a good day.
You too, dear.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Okay,
what kind of music do you like?
Well, I, uh,
several years ago a radio broke in my car
Uh-huh.
and I never,
I got out of the habit of listening to the radio,
and so I haven't been listing,
I, I used to just listen to the rock stations but, um, lately I have been going back to classical music.
Uh-huh.
I don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless, you know, they're in the, the news or something
Uh-huh.
But, um, so I tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when I was paying attention.
Uh-huh.
And then I like some classical music and some of the pieces that have been around a while.
Uh-huh.
I haven't paid much attention to most of the current music.
What about you?
Um, I listen, I listen to a wide variety of music.
Sometimes I'll turn on the classical music, in
sometimes I'll listen to jazz,
Uh-huh.
uh, every now and then country and western.
Um, I'll listen to some of the rock stations.
I also like the, uh, the, the classic rock stations, that play the older, more mellow type rock music and child in
Uh-huh.
Um, some of the, some of the rock stations now are the, I guess the top forty stations or whatever.
They just,
it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials
and, sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating
Uh-huh.
That's true.
and it gets kind of old,
and they play the same songs over and over,
and I just get kind of tired of all that.
Uh-huh.
So lots of times, I'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio, actually.
But, uh, most of my cassettes,
I guess, I don't, I don't like hard rock.
No.
Um, I have some, some rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two country and western. Some, uh, oh, I can't believe I can't think of his name. Um, Garth Brooks,
Uh-huh.
I have a couple of his tapes.
And, um, but it's mainly, it's mainly just the, the light rock type stuff.
Yes,
I don't,
I never liked any of the heavy metal music
Uh-huh.
I never really listened to it because I, you know, I prefer to have more, I guess, an established pattern of music to listen to.
Uh-huh.
But, and I,
back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty, and I listened to some of it,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but I, you know,
now that there's just a million rap groups
and, and, uh, they try to, tend to try to do, outdo each other with raciness, I think,
Oh, yeah.
and, so I, you know, I'm not attracted to that at all,
but, um, it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access,
and so now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on unless there's something I'm particularly listening to.
Uh-huh.
But, you know, if you go two or three years without having that,
what I got the most exposure to
Uh-huh.
it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having a, you know, easy access to current music,
and so I did, like I say, tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that I had, already had purchased.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But we don't have a C D yet, do you?
No,
I don't.
I sure don't
because I have so many albums and cassettes I feel like, gosh, I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then start collecting C D
and it just,
Uh-huh.
I haven't gotten around to doing it yet.
Yeah,
I, I kind of decided to wait until it, it was around a while.
It was kind of like, remember when personal calculators first came out,
Yeah,
yeah.
and they were really, really expensive
and then now you can get one for two or three dollars.
Just like V C R's, too
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
I thought of that, too, that if I wait, it'll get a lot less expensive,
and I can do without it for a while.
Sure
and also they get better quality
Uh-huh.
and they learn to have more features and things and without, and making them less expensive.
Uh-huh.
So we're kind of waiting to, like, uh, now, you know,
and the price of cassettes has gone down because C D are so popular,
Uh-huh.
so,
That's,
and a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too,
right now, I think. They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece.
I haven't even priced them.
I guess they must be.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
That is awful
Yeah
I bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have C D players.
I thought, my gosh,
Uh-huh.
now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while.
Take our time.
Right.
Well, I can't imagine, um,
you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as like a cassette player, where if you heard something, you could record it, you know. Uh, if you have, I guess, if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something, that you'd heard or that you owned an album of,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
so C D won't be nearly as handy.
Yeah,
see, I've got a, on my stereo I've got a, a, uh, turntable, and then I've got a dual cassette
so I can record off other cassettes.
Uh-huh.
But I never realized you couldn't record onto
I just never really thought about it
because I haven't really looked into it very much.
I don't have one
and,
Uh-huh.
and I've never really looked at one very closely,
but that, that would be inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car.
Now I guess, you know, one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess all of them will probably have C D players by then,
Yes.
but, uh, I'm not planning on doing that for a while.
I just got mine paid off
Enjoy it.
I'm going to stick with the cassettes and, and, uh, you know, until, until they,
now my sister, my younger sister has a, she does have a C D player that she got for Christmas
and she's got the, the cassette, so she can record off cassettes onto C D I mean, I'm sorry, other way around, off C D onto cassettes.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Um,
Well, that's good.
so I can record some things from her and, you know, get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if I want to
but but, uh, I just haven't gone to C D yet.
Uh-huh.
Why, we haven't either,
but we, you know, we like the, the idea of having great extra quality, you know, in your music and things.
Uh-huh.
But, but I'm satisfied to just have what I've been used to, not have to think about the great financial sacrifice that that would be, to suddenly try to switch over to all C D or something.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children, um, I really started to think about what kind of television programs I was watching, and what kind of music I was listening to and activities
Right.
Uh-huh.
because, um, you know, I just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things,
and a lot of the, lot of the songs have some lyrics that, um I just wasn't pleased with, you know.
Oh, yeah
And they get worse and worse, too.
Uh-huh.
And so I really think we've tried to tone down our taste there to make, uh, you know, our children not be exposed to so many negative things so early in life.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's amazing how I used to, when I was in college, I used to have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something,
Uh-huh.
but ever since I've been out of college, I guess over the last several years, I listen to the stereo less and less.
Now I, I will turn on,
I've got a small jam box in my bathroom.
I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do
Uh-huh.
and it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup, so I'll turn the radio on
and, and then I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because, again, there's, you know, there's nothing else going on.
Right.
I might as well listen to the radio while I'm driving to work.
Right.
But other than that, I've, I really don't, I don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore.
I guess I'm just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what I want to listen to, and put it on the, on the turntable.
I don't know,
I just don't, don't bother to do it very much anymore.
Yes,
I know what you mean.
I, I know my husband, he, um, plays an instrument
and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school
Uh-huh.
and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music,
and he goes out of his way to play marching band music, or like you say, jazz or classical to the children to, to give them some exposure to different kinds of music.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And I think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds
and,
That's good.
What instrument does he play?
He plays the,
it's a euphonium.
It's like a small, a really small, not a tuba, but I
it's hard to explain
Uh-huh.
I never had known anyone to play one before.
Uh-huh,
I've never heard of that.
But it's kind of like a small, small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder.
Uh-huh.
But it's a cross between a tuba and, and an, and, you know, a horn.
It's a brass instrument.
Uh-huh.
So he plays that and, and a little bit of piano
and but he has some real fond memories of marching band and concert band type activities,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and he thinks that would be good for the kids
Uh-huh,
oh, I'm sure it is.
I'm sure it is.
I was exposed to a lot of music when I was younger.
I,
my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years,
Uh-huh.
and, so I was, I was a real good piano player,
but then I got interested in a lot of other things
and I got real involved in many things
and, and now I don't have a piano in my apartment or anything.
I could sit back down and play a few things, but not like I used to be able to.
Uh-huh.
It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away.
Uh-huh.
And I took guitar lessons, I think, for one or two years,
and, uh, that was about the same time I was taking piano.
And then I got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework and ...
Are you a T I
Uh, yeah,
I am.
Oh, good.
Yeah,
yeah,
I've been, uh,
Yeah,
uh, she had a hard time getting a few folks, uh,
I thought, well every, all these T I have gone home, uh,  at one o'clock on Friday.
I, uh,
It is Friday,
yeah,
that's for sure.
Well, uh, I guess,
I'm trying to think the last thing I did to a car.
I, I, I do it a lot.
I have,
I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Uh, so, and my father and brother were in it
and, and my brother's still in it.
And I had periods when I didn't do anything,
but in the last ten years I've, uh, my car doesn't go to a shop, you know,
it, it,
Uh-huh.
I just do it all.
Do,
I, uh,
there's hardly anything that, other than putting tires on, that I'll do.
I did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but,  I change the oil and transmission
Yeah.
Sure.
and, uh, uh, I do, essentially do it all.
I don't know, uh, uh, if there's anything specific.
In fact, I could advise people, uh,
I happen to be a M E besides.
But I do it for fun really and to save money.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
And I guess that's diversion.
Uh, I, I've, I've tried a few groups, uh, you know, where you,
I can recommend it for people to take their cars.
Like I think Sears is probably the best place
Yeah.
because,  I've heard, when I used to go there and when I,
Yeah.
I just overheard what they did for me, very little because I didn't take it that much.
But what I heard them tell other people was always right.
Right.
You know, when I sat there, I, you know, I dropped my car off for tires or something like that.
Right.
And so I respect,
they seem to actually have mechanics there.
Yeah
yeah.
I was pretty impressed with Western Auto,
but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission, uh, oil last time.
And when when I did it the next time, I realized the filter was loose and everything,
Really?
and I didn't like it.
So I'm just doing it all myself.
I, I,
Yeah.
That's, that's the aggravating thing.
Yeah,
I, I try to do as much as I can.
I, uh, I grew up on farm so I've got that, uh, you know, take care of yourself attitude.
You had to do it.
Yeah,
right.
And, uh, oh, I've done, I've done various things.
I've got an, I've got an eighty-three T Bird
and I've, I've changed out, uh, heater core and,  uh, oh, timing belts and things like that.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Um, I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, um, when we went in for inspection.
Uh-huh.
It didn't, it didn't quite pass.
Yeah.
So we had to have, uh,
that's, uh, that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it.
Uh-huh.
And they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out, to get to it.
Oh, yeah.
And, uh,
Well, you like Fords, apparently, huh?
Yeah,
yeah.
I've, uh, I'm kind of stuck on them right now, I guess.
But, you know, that's,
it's partially because I can work on them.
That's, uh,  that's, that's, that's a big part of my decision.
Yeah.
But, uh, yeah,
we ran into some problems with, uh, having them to work on that carburetor.
I mean, they get, they got everything tuned up right, you know.
But they,
we got, I got it home,
and, uh, and they had left the, uh, oil uh, cap off and it was rubbing on a belt
Really?
and it rubbed a notch in that.
My goodness.
little things like that, that really start to aggravate you.
That, that's a lot of the reason I do my own stuff.
Yeah.
I always wonder when you have little things like that happen, why, even here at T I, why we don't inspect, I'm in facilities, why we don't inspect areas and, and guarantee it so to speak. Uh,
Uh-huh.
we always fix things and put things in and walk away.
We,
there needs to be a time of inspection and check out.
And, and thing like that with a car,
there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned.
There ought to be an inspector or quality insurance guy after, after an oil change, you know.
that's right.
Just in case, uh, they didn't put the oil in or whatever.
Sure.
Yeah,
I, I always wonder about that when, when someone does repairs or little things like that, uh,
Any, anything that gets, that, that's in a, gets to be an, an assembly line type operation,
you're, you're always risking that.
If there's, too many people that get their hands on one little project, you know, that things, they're, you get, you miss that overlap sometimes,
Yeah.
and, and they miss things.
Yeah,
I've, I've had a hard time finding anybody I can trust.
Like, like you say, it, it, well, transmissions and things like that.
I'm, obviously, I'm not going to, I'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission  and try rebuild it.
No,
no,
I don't either.
I don't either,
yeah.
But, uh, it, it's, it's real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right. And, and, uh, you know, have an idea of what's going on.
Yeah.
You need to really, uh,
I, I do, uh, a lot of the simple things.
I, I think I do most of the things better than the average person.
Uh-huh.
You, you have Fords and I, I, uh, I have three Chevys, which
Okay.
I worked my way into having the same engine.
I don't know how long I'm,
Yeah.
I like a V-eight.
And I'm, I'm,  sold on small block Chevy V-eights.
Oh, yeah.
And I,  I bought one car new,
Yeah.
and I almost accidentally got the next car, although I was kind of looking for it when I got a a used car with the same engine.
Uh-huh.
Well then the the truck I got next, I definitely looked for the same engine.
So I buy filters, you know, three or four at a time.
Sure.
And essentially the engines are different
Sure.
the cars are different years, but the same Chevy V-eight.
Uh-huh.
And the the carburetors is the same.
Almost everything is the same.
the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six, you know.
Uh-huh.
So you can learn a lot that way.
I,
there's no way I could, I could fix every car in the world, you know.
Well, yeah.
That, that,
the biggest, you know, that's the three biggest things to me, you know.
number one, you've got to have the tools around.
Yeah.
If you don't have the, the special tools or,
well, any more
the, the testers, that, you know.
Yeah.
I, I don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage, you know.
Right.
So obviously if it starts, my car starts missing or something like that, it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics.
Yeah.
But at the tools and the space to do it, that, that can be a big problem if it's, if it's under carriage or something like that.
But, then it's experience.
You know, you can, you can look through a, a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it.
But you better figure on multiplying that time out, about by at least by five or so. just, just by not knowing, you know, how to get to that, that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was, that was the biggest thing when I did, uh, the heater core in my T Bird.
That is got to be the worst location for it.
Yeah.
And, and the only reason I did it,
I,
I think they're all bad, really.
They're,
Yeah,
yeah.
The, the only ones I've ever heard good, good things about are, are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood.
Uh-huh.
You just open the door and pop it out.
Is that right?
Yeah.
But, but, uh, I, I had, I had taken this in to have it done originally.
Yeah.
And, uh,
What did they want to charge you for it?
Oh, it, it was, it was
well it was about seven hours labor.
Yeah.
So it, it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so.
Yeah.
And they looked it over and they, they, they thought they could patch it up a little bit, you know, and what not.
So they,
This is your little water, uh, heater in there, for the, uh,  the heat inside?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it was, it was leaking inside the car,  in the condenser unit.
Yeah.
So, uh, they, they did a little patch on it,
and it it held for about four to six months.
And I finally went back in and started looking at it myself.
And it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff,
but,
Yeah.
hey,
it was not, uh, it was not a seven hour labor job for me.
Yeah.
It was about a week before I finally through.
Did you get it inside or outside?
I, I took one off my little Buick I had,
and I pretty much took it loose on the inside.
But it came out from the, you know, underneath the hood.
Yeah.
It came from,
Oh, really?
Yeah.
No,
this, this was,
the only thing that sticks, in, inside the engine compartment on this are the two, uh, hose fittings.
Maybe you're right,
maybe you're right.
I,
it's been a long time since I took one out.
Yeah.
It, it's,
I, I've never heard a good story about, uh,
Course, I broke mine, you know,
so I'm always very careful when I change hoses on it.
Yeah.
I don't know whether you did yours.
Not to really pull on those.
I,  when I take those hoses, I cut them off very gingerly.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Because if you you know, pull on that,
and I've always done that as a kid, you know, just yanked on it.
Uh-huh.
And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time.
Sure.
But I broke one on my, on my Buick.
And I always remembered it was my own fault,
and I thought, well I'm going to going to carefully take those hoses off.
You bet.
Well that, that's what ended up being the real problem on this, was the, uh, the, the pipe wasn't busted,
but the,
it wasn't soldered in good enough.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
And it had, it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot,
It, it spread out,
yeah.
and just normal driving didn't do it.
But if, if, if it was an especially hot day, the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was real aggravating,
but, uh, I, I, couldn't even
a week's, a week's time is, is worth a whole lot less than, four, than four hundred dollars to me, you know,  than to have somebody else do it.
Yeah.
Sometimes if you're a tinkerer, you luck out.
My wife's,  uh, Chevy, uh, it was a Caprice, air conditioning stopped.
Uh-huh.
I, I just heard it.
I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in.
Uh-huh.
And I went out there for five minutes,
and I just pushed on the wires.
And sure enough, just pure dumb luck, that the connection over by,
it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side.
Uh-huh.
I just pushed that in, and I heard it click.
Yeah.
And so sometimes you have dumb luck.
I, I was, you know,
you could have taken something like that and thought, well, the compressor's not working. Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. But sometimes you have some dumb luck. If you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out.
Right.
That's true.
I know, I feel bad for people who just, when anything goes wrong, a fuse, you know, they just have to take it.
And I know that's tough if you don't, uh, at least give it a shot.
Uh-huh.
I've got girls, daughters, and I've always said I'd teach them.
And my, my one daughter was fairly interested.
And I really haven't gotten around to,
I learned because I, I just, uh, learned, you know
and, I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things.
Yeah.
And I'm going to do that.
I, I told my daughters in college this year, I said, This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car.
I said, So you can learn the basics, you know.
Well, yeah.
and, and not only from a, from an economic standpoint, just, just pure safety, you know.
If you can, if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to, to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait.
Yeah.
It, it,  it can, it can save a lot of time and trouble.
Right.
I have the,
there's one expression I don't like, uh, the country expression, you know, if it ain't, if it ain't broke don't fix it.
Okay.
All right,
I had to register us in there.
Hopefully you're a basketball fan.
Excuse me.
Hopefully you're a basketball fan.
Yeah,
I'm from Indiana.
Great,
I'm glad you are,
I'm not.
I couldn't care about any of it.
But go ahead,
I, I would like to talk about, uh, maybe college basketball.
I'd like to see it be more of an amateur sport.
I'd like to see it turned back to like the Southwest Conference down here,
I would like to see Texas and all the teams, uh,
since we're supposed to talk about specific teams, I would like to see them turned back to where the college player plays for four years, and then, they're not, they're not semi-pro and just go on and are stolen by the the, the League, you know, in three years,
Uh-huh.
plus I'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're, they're taking a regular college course.
Yeah.
You know, I'd like to see,
they didn't ask that, but they're talking about college teams,
I, you know.
Yeah.
Since you're being, you can talk for hours, go ahead,
you, you, if you like sports go right ahead with this one.
Um, well, I know like what you just said, um,
Purdue had to, had to, uh,
their best player this year, you know, averaged twenty points a game
Yeah.
they had to make him sit the bench. And actually kicked him off the team because, um, his, uh, grades, even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed, you know, N C double A, they weren't, they did not pass, um, Purdue requirements.
And so,
That's surprising that they, that they have better requirements.
That's good.
Yeah.
That's what I like to see.
Go ahead.
And see,
I'm all for that.
so he was treated like all the rest of students, you know.
That's great.
And so, um, their very best player,
they probably lost over half their games, because, you know, by twenty points, which is what he averaged, um,
and so, you know, he had to sit, you know,
he was kicked off the team.
And then they've got three players, top, you know, recruiting class this year that
they're going to have to be, well,
the, the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren't smart enough.
Oh.
Yeah.
You know, it's just sad
because, I mean, Purdue, even though they're one of the few schools that really, uh, stress academics, they're suffering, you know
and,
Oh, I, I agree.
I think that that, there's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference, uh, players come from outside of Texas, you know, and play us here.
Uh, they're obviously practicing sixty hours a week, you know,
and there's no consistency.
Seems to me, that like Purdue, when they're trying,
a student athlete is spending so many hours in class.
He only has twenty, twenty-five, whatever hours he has to spend on practice.
Yeah.
He should be playing, they all should be playing another team that, that has about twenty hours to practice a week.
Like.
But there are teams that practice sixty hours a
week, they're not going to class at all.
I mean, that's, that's what I mean by semi-pro.
Yeah.
There's too many semi-pros in college
and I think they ought to get rid of that.
That's what happened to this guy.
I mean, he was, uh, he didn't go to class, and so they just said, you know, you can't make the grades,
you're going to have to,
see you later.
Well, I'm all for, I'm all for the, oh
baseball has a, uh, a, uh minor league system,
and I think that the football and basketball, they asked us to talk about basketball, should, you know, let, let them go, have a semi-pro team.
But I think, I'd like to see college athletes,
let's talk about college basketball.
I like that.
Yeah.
Any basketball that I like,
I like that.
I, I don't, I don't like the pros at all.
I don't either.
It's.
Uh, they're high scoring,
there's no defense it seems like,
and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points, you know, hundred twenty-two, you know,
and I don't really get much out of that.
Yeah.
Um, yeah,
it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in, in college.
Uh-huh.
And I saw Princeton, I think it was, or Harvard play this year.
They're like all white,
and their starting guard had S A T scores of fifteen hundred.
Uh-huh.
And it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams,
because, it was like, they played so much smarter and more disciplined.
Yeah.
I don't know if they won very many games.
But, I don't know,
their style of play was so much different from from the teams that just run and gun.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I like high school football, which again is not the subject,
but that's so much fun to watch because they're, they're pure amateurs, you know, and there's no money involved.
Yeah.
You go to college,
you don't really know,
it loses it somewhere.
Yeah.
Whatever sport it is, if they're really putting a lot of money in,
these players, let's face it, ninety percent are being paid.
So.
Yeah.
I'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs.
I don't care about seeing the best players in the world play.
I like to see the people going to Texas just play, the ones that are in class.
And I'd like to see athletes, uh, or fellow students, like myself, you know, to play the game.
I, I, in fact, I like amateur sports.
I don't see it has to be,
I don't think that college football, or basketball, should have to be semi-pro, you know.
Yeah.
I wish it'd return to the good old days of the amateur. Everybody play.
That's what I like,
everybody should play, you know.
Yeah.
Well again, I'd just like to see the true athlete, the true student athlete, play basketball, you know.
Yeah.
I don't like to see the ones that aren't, have no intention of going to class, uh.
Yeah.
Then, again just picking a school,
Texas is is usually not the best team, you know,
In
because the other teams are, I'm sure practice a lot more,
and S M U down here in footballs and trying to get back, uh, to having true student athletes,
and, and that's what I think is a lot of fun.
There's just so much pressure on the schools, I think to win, though, you know.
To win and money,
yeah.
Yeah.
And, you know, it's like if they don't win, they don't get any money, so, and the school suffers, which is kind of bad,
but that's just how it always is.
Yeah,
I always thought that university was for an education and then sports of course is part of the education.
I don't think that sports has to make a lot of money, or you do away with it.
I don't know why the don't keep fencing and all that, you know.
Yeah.
And, and they seem to be,
there's articles in the TIME magazine and all about whether it be basketball or anything else.
If it's not making money, then we'll do away with it.
Well, that's not,
I thought it was so that you give them an education of that particular discipline.
Yeah.
And I, I, I just think that amateur sports should stay in universities,
that's where it's at.
I'm sure saddened to see,
I think it was Wisconsin or somewhere, they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things.
I don't know what it was.
I don't think I really know that.
Yeah
Because, uh, you know,
that all depends, too, on where you are at.
That's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. Because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime you know, the, the more, more urban, I mean less,
Uh-huh.
See, yeah,
okay,
well, see, I'm, I'm in kind, I'm in kind,
okay, uh,
we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
and that would be pushing it.
So, I mean this is definitely a college town.
Uh, we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any. Uh,
Two hours where?
North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Oh, okay.
Near Polk?
Oh, I've never heard of Polk
but,
Polk Institute.
It's, uh, an old, uh, university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. Uh,
Oh, I never heard of that.
Very old, uh, historical place there.
It might have a new name.
Sharon, Pennsylvania's up there.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
We're probably about an hour away from Sharon.
Oh, okay.
Uh-huh.
Uh, so, I,
most of the kids here, I, you know,
like, you know, just from dorm mates and stuff, they'll say that they don't believe in it,
but then after I would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah,
you know, you know.
In that case, maybe, you know.
Yeah.
You know, I think people can be persuaded one way or another.
I've never seriously ran into someone, I mean like, other than my priest, you know, who definitely says you can't take a, you know, you can't take anyone's life.
Uh, anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
Right.
That's true.
Yeah,
well, it, it, you know,
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,  done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing,
Uh-huh.
you just
like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know,
I mean, that is just terrible.
yeah
Uh-huh.
And, uh, you know, we had a case like that here
and, on the other hand, you know, people are saying that because the, he knows, because the criminals know that the, uh, penalties can be very severe,
they, uh,
there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.
Yeah,
Yeah.
Well, I'm just saying that, that, that's what, the, the client, lawyers are saying.
They're saying that, you know, you know, more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to, to, to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's something, you know
but, uh, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.
Right,
uh-huh.
So I don't think that they deserve anything less
Yeah,
right.
It's just,
I don't, I don't know,
I just
Uh-huh.
I was just saying that way,
what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then.
And so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.
Uh-huh,
and that costs money, yeah.
And perhaps we can
and perhaps we can't
and so the guy might get off.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways
but,
There's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.
Yeah.
Anyways, but, uh. Yeah,
we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared
and, and the guy, like I said, he just, uh, said that he took her,
but he won't admit that she died or whatever,
and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.
So, how do we fix the national budget?
Damned if I know.
Um, I don't know,
I suspect, uh,
let's see,
I suspect we should do what everyone says we should do,
we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes
but Lord knows you one shouldn't say that.
Well,
That would probably be good,
but, something that the government hasn't been looking at is the source of the problem.
Huh.
The true source of the problem is, a, that we do spend too much,
Yes.
but also, b, that we don't take in enough.
Yeah,
well, why do you say that actually?
Uh, too few Americans are working.
Huh.
If more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor,  and paying taxes,  and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans, then we would have more money there to play with.
Yes.
Rather than using taxes.
Oh, that's interesting.
Yeah,
that's probably true,
I mean, well, we also, we'd be spending less because all the money that, that normally goes to support those people aren't working, it's back in the system.
Right.
So, you're right.
That's a real neat idea.
Well, what,
but, I mean, what can, you know,
at, at some point, what can you do to sort of raise I mean, to raise jobs I wonder.
Well, I hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to affluence
but, in fact, in some cases that's what we ought to do.
Oh, okay.
So, start .
Not Reaganomics, thank you.
But, that's not going to work, uh,
Uh, what I was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space.
Huh.
And that way just create more jobs or whatever?
Well, at some point there, there will be enough jobs for most of the able-bodied Americans.
Huh.
well, that's a neat idea.
We also need to, uh, assure that there's some work in the private sector.
Yeah,
that's what, that's what,
you think space would do that much for that
or,
I think it would do something for it.
I think we would fill up new technologies.
But I think we should also do something rather radical.
Like what?
Legalize marijuana.
Oh, you think, you think that would, uh, have a major effect?
Well, that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway.
What?
that might have a, uh, a good effect on, on, on crime anyway.
Yes, uh,
okay,
I think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals.
I think it would put, reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another.
That's probably true.
I think that, I think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax.
And probably a lot of.
And probably a lot of
and really receive some revenues from.
Yeah
but that's potentially ,
Uh, if you look at prohibition historically, it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues.
Uh-huh, huh.
No,
I had never thought about that.
Then I think once we put money back into the in the coffers of the federal government,  and get the federal government to where there's money there again, we should reduce the amount of money,
Uh-huh.
and this would have to come rather quickly, and would have to come originally also where we're not paying,
in some cases we do pay more, for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment.
That's true we do, often times they are paid more, yeah.
And you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means.
Right.
That's just sensible on their part.
That's just what on their part,
I'm sorry,
I missed that.
It's just sensible on their parts,  to go after the, the, the greater amount of income.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So, if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs, not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage, then more people will get off welfare.
That, that maybe true.
That's very true.
You know, give them a true incentive to want to work.
Right.
And then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment.
Right,
that's a,
Reduce immigration,  or eliminate it entirely for a few years, until we get our own house in order.
Huh.
Yeah,
and maybe even reduce, along the same lines, maybe reduce imports as well, I think.
Oh, absolutely,
absolutely.
That's right,
when we're in a world of hurt, well, I don't, I'm not going to say that we ought to reduce them through legal means.
I think we ought to just tax them severely.
Right,
well, that, that's what happened in other country though.
And other places they tax us quite
I mean, they tax American imports quite heavily.
So, we could do the same thing,
I mean, just,
and, you know, they may get,
It seems only fair.
Right,
it does seem only fair,
I mean, why not.
And I think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes, created new jobs for that work force, there would be plenty of money.
I think so.
And then at that point,  quit spending on space.
Yes.
Oh real ,
Force it all into the, into the private sector.
Oh, really I love the switch.
Well, at that point you might, we, it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly, you know,
we would be,  we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do,
That's right.
but I think the,
Uh, space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of,  a lot of
Right.
Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications,
Uh-huh.
that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work.
Right,
compared to defense.
Well, that's a good idea.
Well, it,
well, the other thing, and the other thing I, I, I think we seriously need to do is, um, like I say, have someone go in and look and, you know, and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something.
You know what causes that?
Um, greed, I suspect.
Uh, no.
Your, your buying large , uh,
the government specifications,
Uh-huh.
sheets of paper for building a pair of B V D underwear for the federal government,  is twenty-two foot tall.
Yeah.
Really?
If it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another.
For making, you mean, government issue underwear?
For making government issue underwear.
Jesus.
To just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines,  costs the company a huge amount of money.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's potentially a fault of the government then, I mean, that could, things like that should,
Yes,
a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor.
Right,
well, that's a,
I had never heard that before.
Uh, a huge amount of what you hear on, about the seventy-five dollar hammers,  and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesn't come from people in the industry,
Right.
it comes from senators that don't know anything about it.
Huh.
Uh, my job is government tooling specialist.
Oh, okay,
so, you know about some of these things.
Yeah.
or Okay,
what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have?
Oh, not very many of those at, uh,
sometimes I, I play the trumpet,
and sometimes I work on trumpet mouthpieces.
Uh-huh.
And then I have a five year old daughter
and we cut out things, kind of, you know, and color and, uh, and, uh, use markers and things like that.
Uh-huh.
Um, how about you?
In,
well I used to be more into crafts, when I was younger, like high school stuff.
I was in four H
and I did a lot of latch hook made rugs and stuff.
Uh-huh.
Um, and, uh, I've learned how to crochet,
but I don't really know,
I mean, I don't do it that much.
Not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad.
Um.
I'd rather be outside.
Yeah,
exactly.
Um, I used to play trombone
Uh-huh.
I don't know if that was a,
not really,
I don't play it that much any more,
but I, um,
what else do I do.
Mainly do reading.
I don't have a lot of crafty type things I do.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, what are some other things you enjoy?
I don't know.
My, my father is in the, in the antique business.
Uh-huh
And he, uh, he goes around to garage sales
and he buys all kinds of, um, china and figurines and statues and stuff.
Uh-huh.
And, um, there's some stuff that's really for, uh, auto repair.
It's called J B Weld
Uh-huh.
and I repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once.
But he, mixes colors in it.
It's an epoxy resin that you mix together.
Oh, cool.
And he makes like,
the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a, a statue that's real small,
it's like about maybe
the hand's about the size of a cricket. And, uh, has, uh, like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out,
Oh, wow.
and he was repairing that,
and, uh, it came out pretty good.
It's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over and  and, uh, has some age spots in it,
Uh-huh.
and it looked, you know, just like it, it had been there all the time.
Huh
And he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, uh, molds that in.
He had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he fixed that way.
Uh-huh.
It worked out real well, too.
And then,  And and then he, uh, he thatches, uh, you know, those, uh, thatched chairs.
Do you ever,
Huh?
Yeah.
Course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about.
Yeah.
That takes a lot of time.
That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.
Yeah.
And he used to paint, um, a long time ago,
but I think he's stopped pretty much now.
Oh
But outside of, outside of art class in, in school, I, I stopped doing most of that, unless I, I mean, like he has a computer,
and I use, um, the graphics um, software on that, to, uh, to do figures and to look at things, you know, see how they work.
Yeah.
Right.
That sounds interesting.
Uh-huh.
Um, does, does he ever, uh, refinish furniture or anything like that?
Oh, yeah,
sometimes,
but it's not one of my favorite things, especially from the vapors,
and we had, uh, an entertainment center we did last year.
Uh, we bought it at an, unfinished, uh, furniture place
Uh-huh
Pretty time consuming, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
But, it's it's nice to have it when you're done,
I mean, looks pretty.
Uh-huh,
sure is.
So, I've done that once
but it didn't come out that well.
Did you use a, did you use a Zar stain?
Uh, I don't remember.
It was,
I had my parents buy everything,
and I ended up,
it was their table, their kitchen table.
It came out really dark.
Um, they had a, um,
well I saw the commercial on T V,
and they,
and, uh, and the people at the unfinished store recommended it,
that's called,
it's Z, A R
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it spreads real evenly
and it doesn't dry too fast,
so it's,
if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.
Yeah.
And uh, we, put, we put tung oil on it.
Kind of made it sticky for a while.
But after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard,
and it was all right.
I remember it took me a long time,
it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer,
and then after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.
Since I've moved away they've had it redone.
So, I kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick.
Yeah.
But, I don't know.
Like I said, I like doing a lot of outdoor stuff,
so but during Four H, I mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is interesting,
I like that
Uh-huh
Were you in a, were you the Girl Scouts, too
or,
No,
well, yeah
when I was real young I was for a couple, of years
Excuse me.
So, uh, anyway, it was nice talking to you Dudley.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
Have a good day now.
Okay,
you too.
Bye or
Bye-bye.
Okay,
what do you read?
Uh, well, I read everything, uh, I guess, uh,
What is your favorite?
Uh, well, I like all kinds, uh,
in fact I was just reading, uh, a magazine now. An automobile magazine.
Uh, I like historical, uh, books, TIME magazine, newspaper, how, how to do it type things, uh, uh.
Oh, I am not much into magazines.
I do read them.
I like GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and stuff like that.
I will get ideas out for my own house and yard and stuff
Uh-huh.
Main thing, I like Pierce Anthony.
I love Pierce Anthony novels.
Oh, the novels, yeah.
No,
I am not into soap, soaps and all that stuff.
I am, uh, not into novels at all really, other than historical things.
Uh, uh, I am kind of a, a chore person.
I like to do,
I am again, I am a fix it person.
I, I would read all those kinds of things.
Figures . What, like those, uh, magazines you get through the mail?
Yeah.
I will buy car magazines,
course I am an engineer
and I read the engineering magazines, and the money magazines.
I,
And, uh, well, I am reading historical, uh, not a novel, but historical book now about the, uh, Russia before, uh, the czar, not before the czar, during the czar's time and what it was like and everything.
Uh-huh.
What about like those TIME books that they put out about, uh, uh, oh, ancient discoveries?
You know,
how they found out like that, uh, ancient man, performed, uh, brain surgery successfully?
And stuff like that.
Oh, you mean the ancient astronauts things?
Uh-huh.
I have read some of that.
I, I did not,
some of that is, uh, it is very interesting, without question.
Uh-huh.
I, I do not really know that they have the answers in those books.
they, make conclusions in them that may or may not be true.
Yes.
Oh.
But they are very interesting. that, they have, what they have discovered.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I like far out facts or whatever.
Yeah.
I like to read stuff like that.
But I am a superficial buff.
I cannot take a day I just,
You are what kind of buff?
Superficial,
Oh, okay.
I like, I like it if it is fun.
I do not get too into it.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, I am kind of a hobbyist
so I, I read all those things that, uh,
and being an engineer, all those books that would bore everybody else, you know, how to do things.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well,
I am one of those crazy people that reads the directions.
It always make my wife mad.
I,
Because you read it
when she ever there is something, I say, well, have you read the directions?
another "No,
I hate reading the directions."
I say, well, engineers, we, we are the few people in the world that read
You are an engineer?
Are you an engineer for T I?
Yeah.
Okay, uh,
I worked at T I for a little while.
Uh-huh.
Uh, we have got a book that says, uh, HOW DO THEY DO THAT?
Yeah.
And it answers everything.
Oh, really?
Yeah
And I,
well, not everything
but a lot of silly little questions.
Oh, yeah.
That,
Like what makes a firefly light,
Oh,
yeah.
Those are, oh, interesting.
Oh, you like science things?
Uh, I have not gotten them in a long time.
What is that, uh, one that is on T V?
That book, uh, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC is really a fascinating book, uh, uh, if you ever get those
Now.
or
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Well, that, do not,
But I have not gotten them in years, uh,
they were kind of expensive.
I know people just collect them like they are,
Yeah.
uh,
They have wonderful photographs and just amazing photographs that they have done.
Yeah.
We used,
my little sister was blind and going to school,
and she would have to come home at night, cut out different,
she was not fully blind, just legally blind.
Yeah.
But she would have to cut out different colors,
and that is the best book to go through, those NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.
It is.
It is.
They, they, they, uh,
the photographers just got fantastic pictures in those things. Uh,
And they are great.
I love reading about animals.
Uh-huh.
The gorillas and stuff.
Yeah.
And the sloth, it fascinates me.
That's something moves that slow
Oh, yeah.
And it is just weird.
You know, I have not, uh,
of course, was it all books and things
or was it any,
did it say anything about newspapers?
I have forgotten what the question was exactly.
But, uh, what do you read, I guess, in general?
Oh, well,
Or,
Yeah.
Well, we can talk about anything we want.
Yeah.
Uh, I, I glance at all newspapers.
I do like, uh,
since the since the economy is doing so bad, I never have read the, uh, uh, financial pages more often than now, you know. And trying to analyze and look for some good news in, in there, you know. Uh, to see if the,
Well, for me there is no
well, you know,
But like I said, I do not keep up on all that.
Well, I have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything.
I thought well, uh, see if there is anything in there that, uh, uh, would be positive, you know.
Yeah.
The,
You always look for things with, with this terrible recession that we are in, uh, to see if there is any
Yeah.
With everything going down?
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
It is, uh,
hopefully, uh, we will recover here, uh,
Yeah,
I know I heard Bush say that, you know, we are either bottoming out or seem to be.
Yeah.
But that is Bush saying that
Yeah.
Right
and he, he,
yeah,
I know,
I do not really know if, uh, any one person knows, uh, uh, what some of the problems are.
Uh, but there, there are some, there are some interesting things in the paper, really.
Yeah.
Well, I like Ann Landers
Yeah
No.
I like getting the paper and reading the want ads
and just,
I do skim over it.
It,
But mainly I am a front page person.
I do not go into the details.
Yeah.
No,
I glance at it.
I, I
with the, so much, uh,
you sound like you have a family too.
But with a family and everything, there is just so much going on that I, uh, actually I am more of a
not more of a radio buff
but, uh, it is easier to do when I do some chores, or yard work or anything, put the radio on and listen to that.
And,
Well, I know at T I they have most of the stuff on the printout, don't they? I mean, on the computer where you can read the daily news?
Oh, yeah.
I do,
every time I come in, uh, I will punch up,
but they call it T News and all that.
Uh-huh.
And I, I do get, uh,
it gets a little bit of everything. you know, about, you can read it in one minute, you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
When I
Huh.
Uh-huh.
I know you do, being an engineer.
Yeah.
There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off
Yeah.
Not much,
not in the area I worked in
We had an engineer in there every ten minutes.
Yeah,
yeah.
So,
Oh, yeah.
It is, it is, it is, uh, interesting, uh, with the computer to read the computer news and, all that.
I, I guess that is a, that is a source of reading.
I hadn't thought about that in that respect, uh,
Yeah.
Well, it just encouraged me to read it.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
It, it does have a good, uh, simple, uh, you know,
again you can read it in, uh, in a lot less than ten minutes.
It is usually,
Uh-huh.
you can, you can page through it in,
Yeah.
I do not read everything on,
some of the stuff is pretty boring.
I, I skip over some of that.
But, uh, uh, it is,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
I do not,
Well,
uh, I read it so less
and I watch so little T V, I did not even know what the deal was with this, uh, oh,
I cannot remember his name now.
Him and his wife are getting divorced,
and he is tycoon or something.
Oh, yeah. Uh,
What is his name?
uh, Trump.
Donald Trump.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Trump.
I did not even know, I still do not know what the whole deal was with that.
Well, I guess because he was so rich, you know.
When you are that rich, uh, you always get into the paper, whatever, if you have a family problem, whatever.
Oh
Well, he had a young girlfriend.
He was, he is well into his forties,
and I guess he got a young girlfriend who, uh,
and, and then every, every time you take,
Yeah.
Immediately.
So that is all it was?
He was just having an affair on his wife?
Well, that
and, uh, his business is going down the tubes so bad, you know.
Huh.
He was, uh, uh, essentially like you said, a tycoon.
Uh, Donald Trump and had it all.
He was high roller for about ten years,
and then he is now, uh, essentially bankrupt, you know.
Oh.
And so, uh,
That has got to be hard to go from really rich
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
right, uh,
who knows, uh, what he has really got.
But, uh, he was kind of an arrogant guy,
so I think the newsmen, uh, enjoyed, uh, writing about him on his way down, you know.
Yeah.
It was, uh, she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his, uh, did very well.
Huh.
Ivana Trump, uh.
Oh, yeah,
Well, see that is like I said. I like, I do not watch much T V any more either.
Huh.
But I have got three kids
Oh, yeah.
I can imagine.
Right,
yeah.
Uh, uh, I know what you mean, really.
Well, anyway, I have enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Yeah,
well, uh, hang in there.
And good luck with those kids.
Yeah.
And have a good holiday.
Right.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Basically, uh, my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases.
We really don't get into small little purchases.
If we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card,
but, other than that it's not something that we use a lot of.
Uh, we may have only two or three versus, uh, I know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or, uh, up to a dozen credit cards,
but, uh, ours are just major credit cards that we have and, uh, use, uh, use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase.
Yeah,
is that like Visa and and Mastercard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you have department store credit cards too,
or,
Uh, yeah,
one Sears.
Uh-huh.
Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do, uh, Appliances and things like that
Appliances.
and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that
so,
Yeah.
But, uh, we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate.
If you've got the cash to pay for something, it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards, unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two, three month period,
but if it's, uh, any large purchases, uh, you've got to kind of think about, uh, how much you're going to put down as far as, uh, payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off,
Yeah.
Right
so,
My, my husband and I do basically the same thing,
but we, we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us.
Uh-huh.
We still pay it off every month if it kills us
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
But, we do it mainly for, you know, the cash flow,
what is that, oh, float.
That's the word, float.
Uh-huh.
Sure,
sure.
And, I often will keep track of what I've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already.
Uh-huh.
Sure,
so you know.
And sometimes just,
and keep a list and make sure I
Sure.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Oh.
Exactly
If we go out to a restaurant, oh, just to float it,
or, I don't know.
Or, if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important, too to keep a better receipt of it.
Yeah.
Yes,
my husband has a, a,
So, yeah.
Or anytime like a plane ticket, or, you know
Uh-huh.
Even if we have the,
I'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it,
but the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that. That thirty days or whatever.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Oh, sure.
For the month or whatever.
Yeah.
Exactly.
So,
We have a new one from A T AND T
and we have, you know, haven't used that one too much
Uh-huh,
yeah.
Be interesting,
that's nice, because you can use it for a calling card also.
Exactly,
sure.
It's a Mastercard, too,
so
Sure,
yeah.
It's kind of fun, uh,
but you get a lot of junk mail about them.
Oh, yeah
and you always get these preapproved, uh, credit card things coming through, uh,
your credit is great,
so let's send you another credit card
or it's preapproved for,
Yeah,
you're such a a wonderful person
That's, that's to entice you to get more credit cards.
We'll give you five thousand dollars up front
Yeah.
And so, you know, we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit
I mean, you know, you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff,
so.
Right.
Do you have, uh, an annual fee on yours
or do you get yours through a bank
or,
Uh, ours is through a bank, yeah. *should they 'yeah' be a seperate slash unit?
Yeah.
We had it a long time ago through a bank
and it just a
but,
Yeah.
I, I can't see paying an annual fee for it.
I mean I almost
Oh, you're already paying them, uh, if you're, if you don't pay it off within that month, interest, anyway,
so, yeah,
that's exactly it
so,
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, it sounds like I'm being paged otherwise.
Okay.
So
All right,
thanks a lot.
Good talking to you.
Bye now.
Okay.
Did you want me to go ahead?
I'll let you go ahead and start, yeah. of that kind of stuff
Okay.
Well, one thing,
I, I guess both of us are very much aware of the equality.
Uh, it seems like women are, uh, just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in, uh, jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did.
Uh, it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes, making supper, or taking care of the kids
or uh,
the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which, uh, they did everything.
They went to work
and they took care of the family,
so.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.
but my husband is wonderful.
Yeah,
that's the way my husband is too.
I mean it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes.
Yeah.
It doesn't bother him at all to do the laundry verses, uh, men from way back.
There is that,
well, if you did that you were henpecked or whatever.
But, men are starting,
Yeah,
yeah.
There are still some that aren't cooperating
but
Yeah,
those are very few.
I think those men don't last very long in relationships because I think women know what they want.
They're not accepting that anymore.
Right,
exactly.
Yeah.
And it's, it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything, uh, you know, and then kind of real light pay.
There's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all.
So it's, it's kind of a, uh, neat thing to see as far as equality in the households,
and I think that's even going to get better. Even, you know, even more so.
Yeah.
I think it's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this.
It will be, uh,
hopefully for my daughter who I instill into, it doesn't matter if you want to drive a truck, honey,
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse,
it doesn't matter if you want to be, uh, the President,
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor,
it doesn't matter.
It's what you want to be.
So I have always instilled into her,
and I think mothers, um, are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say, hey, you don't have to stay with nursing,
you don't have to be a secretary,
you don't have to be,
Yeah.
so.
Yeah.
Well, I feel like, um, to an extent that is really important, you know, that, that, um, it is important for women who need to work uh, or are in a position that they want to that they can do that.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
If they want to, right.
Uh-huh.
Um, but I also think it is important for them to be with the children.
I do too.
I, I think there, there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men.
You know, there's a certain part of me,
Uh-huh.
And there are some things that men are designed to do better than women.
Yeah.
I don't think it should ever be totally equal.
Yeah.
You know that's not, uh,
we're not made like that.
Well, emotionally I think, uh, women do a little bit, uh,
That's right.
I, I think that's, the gap is coming closer as, um, what I've learned in, uh, just, just being out there.
It seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings,
and they get together
and they talk about issues of marriage, talk about manhood, talk about what they didn't have with their fathers.
Huh.
Are expressing more emotions, learning what emotions are.
It may be in the future that men, you know, some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves.
Um I, I know of some mothers that I, I guess I'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding, more, um, low key, more apt to be a better father than some mothers that I have seen that have been raised, you know, to develop whatever skills that they have,
Yeah.
and some of the men are developing, uh, very good too.
So, it may come down to where it's, it's individual basis. Where everybody is treated an as individual, and not by sex.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you want to stay home and take care of the kids, honey, that's fine.
I will go out and make the, uh, take care of the, uh, money making.
And it, it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that.
One of the frustrations that I have with the way things have developed is that, and for some it's not a problem, but there's more and more, it's difficult for a family to make a living on one income.
On one income,
uh-huh.
It can be done,
Yeah.
but you make sacrifices.
Yeah,
that,
You know, and, and it's, um,
Kind of like what, uh, my husband and myself are doing right now.
My daughter's three, even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with,
she's an only child.
I don't know,  if you've only got one,
Yeah.
All righty.
Okay.
What type of home do you have in Dallas?
We have a, uh, four bedroom split brick home in, in Richardson actually.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three.
So, we've seen it go up in value wise real well
Oh, good
Yes
And it's probably typical of your neighborhood.
Yes,
yes.
It, it looks like all the others.
It's, uh,
I'm in Plano just, you know, north of where you live.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago.
So, my home is typical.
It's a, a brick home.
A two story brick home,
and it's typical of of the other homes in our neighborhood too.
Yes,
you're in the, the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings,
Yes.
and, uh-huh.
those are lovely.
Yes.
The, the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling,
we're from the north
and we just couldn't stand the wasted space,
so we had them,
we have a high entry hall
and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to, um, nine feet so we could get bedrooms above.
Oh.
Oh, nice.
So, that way we, we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area
but we don't have so much wasted space.
Yes.
And we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way.
Have you, um, found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings?
Mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood.
Are they?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, I would expect so.
Yes.
Right,
I know.
Our air conditioner, during the summer we,
it's over three fifty a month.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
just to air-condition it,
so.
Well, how many bedrooms do you have in your home?
I have, uh, a master bedroom and a den on the main floor,
and then upstairs I have three bedrooms
and I have,
I'm a writer
and I work in my home
so, above the garage area I have a studio.
Oh, uh-huh.
So, it's not really a bedroom.
It doesn't have a closet
and it, and it's the size of a three car garage.
Uh-huh.
So, that's where I work.
That's a pretty good size room.
Yes,
yes.
That's neat.
So we,
this is our dream home,
and we just absolutely, love it.
I,
Well, it sounds like a real nice one.
Yeah,
we're, we're really proud of it.
I just hope we never have to move again.
This is
Right.
Where did you move from?
Uh, Detroit this last time.
Oh, uh-huh.
We were there two years
and,
Uh-huh.
Do you like the Dallas area?
Oh, we love it.
And I would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are, uh, a much better value down here, aren't they, than they are,
Yes,
and they're much, much better constructed down south than they are up north too.
Oh, really?
The,
Now that's interesting.
Uh-huh.
The quality of the workmanship, we noticed a tremendous difference.
Uh-huh.
and they just didn't care.
If the trim work didn't line up it's just, that's just what you get
That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes, you know, are that good down here.
Oh.
And, uh, so that's interesting.
Yes.
Well, the carpenter and painter and, you know, everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built,
and they'd say just look at this,
and you know, they seemed so proud of everything they did.
Well, that's good.
And it really made a difference to us.
Well, I know as I, as I said our house is about seventeen years old
and, uh, we've been very pleased with it.
We've had no major problems with it.
Knock on wood
Yes.
And, uh, you know, it is with, uh, with the, you know, two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it, all the time.
Oh.
So, and we like our neighborhood.
It, it, has, has grown
Yes.
and the majority of the people, you know, keep up the neighborhood.
Uh-huh.
That's important too.
And that's very important
and, and as I said it, it has risen in value.
Uh-huh.
But we bought back when housing was so low,
Oh.
and, you know, and now you know,
then it started jumping by leaps and bounds.
Yes.
It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit,
Yeah,
but we're still fine.
ours is pretty much level in the two years that we've been there.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
We're hoping it takes off again,
but I don't know with the E D S building and Penny's and everything going in up on Legacy, we're hoping that brings in more people.
Yes
It should bring up your property values a little bit.
That's what we're hoping because, we're, we're just real close to, to where that is.
Your pricing.
Uh-huh.
So,
I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves, I think the housing will go up.
Uh-huh.
I hope so too.
You know. Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs, and everything
Yes.
so that's, you know, that keeps prices down and value down
Yeah.
and I'm sure the packs , uh, or
would like for it to go up.
Yes,
I'm sure
For that reason it can stay the same,
That's right
but But we love being where we are.
That's right
Okay.
Well, basically I am a mother of a three year old,
Uh-huh.
so I kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's, uh, extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child, uh, trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that.
Right.
And, uh, I've been pretty selective,
and what I'm finding is with, um, day cares that are like day care centers like, for instance, uh, Learning Tree or Kinder Care and all of that. Uh, like nap time or whatever time, uh, because of parents' hours they are
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and when I bring my daughter into such a system like that, uh, they only have one thing going on
and that's nap time.
Everybody is napping, whether they came there an hour before or they came right during that time.
Uh-huh.
And with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down, on a cot.
Uh-huh.
So, um, home day care has been an option.
And I've looked into that.
The only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe, uh, can you trust the people, you know.
That's right.
Um,
And you never know.
I have, um, an ex-sister-in-law that, um, currently has a child abuse case on a home baby-sitter.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Oh, sure.
Sure.
That's really scary.
And, To the point that you kind of say to yourself, especially home day care
Uh-huh.
I mean, I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours, it's fine.
Right.
It depends on the age of the child.
Now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while
but home home day care works well if it's an infant.
Right.
If it's, if it's,
Uh-huh.
The kids have, colds
Right.
and they're sick all the time
and
Okay,
I don't,
do you have an opinion on that, on the U S R?
Well, the,
I think I'm, I'm skeptical about the whole thing. Uh, and a, still a little bit worried about them because of the the history of Russia.
Uh-huh.
And they're in a, in a state of flux right now changing, uh, uh, changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
And even in that situation, uh, the, it seems like to me from what I've read in, in the history of Russia and, and you know different authors, uh, there has always been a paranoia
They've always suspected everybody
and and that's why they put, you know, that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years,
Sure.
and that's why they put a lot of people to death.
Sure,
that happens.
Yes,
but Stalin was a, was a classical example I guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than, uh, you know, the Russian army killed anybody else.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war.
Uh, they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together,
but I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S. Um, because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation.
Um, from what I've been hearing is the U S, uh, S R has been, uh, almost bankrupt for years
Yeah.
and it's people are desperate,
and there might be a revolution within the people.
But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, uh, there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision.
Sure.
So, I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses, uh,
you get these small little, uh, places like Iraq and all of that, that might be something that I'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses, uh, a small, uh, or as big country of U S S R.
I, I, I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally you know, it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time.
Yeah.
So, I mean sure
they have weapons to kill us over and over and over,
but to them that would be a suicide
and they,
and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people.
But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of, you know, doing whatever, uh, for their country, they'll do it. Uh,
Yeah,
you're a, I think you're right.
There's a little more craziness down there
Uh, the Russian people I think are not that much different from us.
Sure.
You know I think they're, that it would be the leadership that I, I, uh, mistrust.
sure.
I have a daughter that's frustrated.
She's on a, a stool that she can get up on
Yeah.
but
if she can't get down on it it's like, get me down right now
But anyway it was really good talking to you,
and you have a good weekend.
You too.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Bye now.
Bye-bye.
Okay,
as far as, uh, universal health care um, I guess I'm all for it.
Uh-huh.
I think it's time that we start looking at, uh, getting into that.
Um, health cost has continued to rise
and I think, uh, there's people that to me it's the fundamental, uh, life of a person.
Uh, it doesn't matter if you have money or no or all the money in the world, um,
you would,
You should still be
Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits.
Um, I think if, uh, they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and, uh, individuals, um, helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how.
But, uh, the expenses right now for health care, um, are just unreal.
Well, they really are even for, even when you're not talking about surgery.
If you're just talking about basic care,
we've we've got four children
Yes.
and, you know in the past month they, it just, they pass things from one to one
Uh-huh.
Oh, sure.
and it just can devastate your budget, you know.
And your constantly,
Exactly.
Yeah.
The only,
I, I know that, um, uh, I know a little bit about the, uh, European, uh, universal health care
and there's some pros and cons.
One of the things, of course, is everybody gets health care,
but, uh, sometimes health care, uh, when you get into a universal system lacks in, uh, what would be considered, uh,
how can I say it?
Um, over like in Poland, uh, where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is, um,
because no financial gains are available for doctors.
Uh, they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason,
but most people that go in to being a physician here in the U S do it for financial gain.
They say, well, jeez. If I get into this area of dermatology, I don't have to do this,
I can do this,
and I can, you know,
Can still make big bucks
Yeah,
or plastic surgery
or, uh, if I become a, uh, heart specialist I'm going to make this kind of money, uh,
and there's, you know, financial gains toward that.
And in a universal system I don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors.
Do you think that the quality, um it would would be as high?
The quality I think goes down. Uh-huh when you have a universal system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check, um, and also offering some kind of,
because I think, uh, all physicians, well, anybody, um, likes the ability to kind of, uh, get themselves financially, uh, situated.
Uh, I guess that's the whole U S concept is to come here and,
Right.
More motivation
Yeah,
and I don't know if you can have that with a universal system.
Maybe, you know, there's a way of working that out,
but I know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it.
That's what they look at it as.
Yeah.
There's no, uh,
and that's sad because if that's the case, if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway.
Right.
But that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind.
Yeah.
That's true.
Yeah.
So.
I, uh,
But I, I think we have to head toward that way.
Well, we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured
Uh-huh.
and, and you know you cannot,
I mean it's just,
I'm worried when I get older.
Oh, sure.
You know, and, uh, let's say for instance you, uh, get fired or not fired but maybe laid off from your job.
You no longer have insurance.
Right.
I mean and you're sixty some or fifty some years old you try, try to find insurance.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.
I mean you're uninsurable. Unless you want to pay five hundred, six hundred dollars a month
That's right.
and I know people that are paying two hundred, three hundred dollars a month for insurance.
Yeah.
And how they can do it I have no idea.
Um, I know working for small corporations
and health insurance, um, myself, um, it would cost for a family
and this was back three, four years ago to put my entire family up
and this was working for like a med center, uh, health plan.
Um, it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck.
Yeah.
So,
Well, our ours is three hundred for our family
and I mean we, that is, we pay that instead of a car payment. You know.
See.
Yeah.
I mean I'm driving a piece of junk, you know
Well, we do the same.
I mean it's,
I think, uh, people are changing their viewpoints of, you know,
it's getting harder and harder to survive.
Right.
And, uh and that's why, uh, if they don't go to a universal system, something is going to happen.
Right.
Yeah.
We're going to have, uh, a larger amount of people dying.
Okay,
well, what, uh, what do you all do for camping?
Well, we don't do so much now,
but when, uh, I was, uh, a child, we went regular old camping, tents and and everything like that.
Uh-huh.
And then with our children, we did, uh, we had a pop up tent camper.
Uh-huh.
And we used that to go camping.
Where do you go?
We, uh, years ago we lived in Oklahoma
and we went to, uh, Lake Ardmore, I mean Lake Murray all the time.
Oh. Uh-huh.
But, when we did it with our children, we lived in, uh, Tennessee
and we went up to the Smokeys. Which was just absolutely fantastic.
Oh.
Oh, I bet it was.
Around Gatlinburg, or somewhere up in there?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And along the, uh,
there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee through, uh, Georgia and into Alabama
Well, now did you all sleep in sleeping bags
and did it get real cold at night,
or,
It got real cold,
but the, uh, camper had, uh, beds in it, you know when we had that one,
Oh, yeah.
and, uh, so we just, you know, we had our bedding.
We didn't have to go with sleeping bags.
But the when I was a, a teenager and growing up, that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or, you know ground
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, that got kind of rough sometimes
Well, we only did that once.
Now since we've been married, we just go, uh, we go real often to Colorado to the mountains,
but we'll stay in cabins. And, you know, call that going camping,
Oh, do you?
Oh, uh-huh.
but we're really not.
But, the one time that I did go camping when I was about, I guess sixteen or seventeen with my family,
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh.
And at night it was so cold, you thought you'd never feel your, feet again.
And the smell,
and the stars were just five feet above you.
You know, they were just right there.
Oh, just beautiful.
And it was the most bonding, most wonderful time.
We enjoyed it.
But about the fourth day, I thought, if I don't get a hot tub and shave my legs, I'm going to die
Yes.
And I had I, I got enough of it right then.
Yes,
I understand that
So, when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water I'm a little bit better off.
But, yeah
my husband and I, his, he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt.
I know that .
And I, I agree with him.
I agree with him, too.
Our children are, are grown,
but I know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the T V and the phone.
Well, that's true.
Uh-huh.
And we got just strictly by ourselves.
We, uh,
some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us.
Uh-huh.
And, you know, and we could, you know, get back in touch with each other
Well, that, that's,
And they can't believe that they could survive it.
And then once they're there they, they think it's kind of cool.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Oh, they just, you know, they just thoroughly enjoy it. You know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we hike, we would hike all day.
Mom did the whole, uh, pork and beans and, you know, the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do
Yes,
yes.
You know, couldn't believe,
Yes,
like I, I know that, you know, breakfast, we would, you know, we'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little Coleman stove
Oh, yeah,
with bacon.
and, Yes,
Oh, yeah.
and it would just absolutely taste wonderful.
And, and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast
Yes
so we usually had a bite apiece
One.
One,
yes,
yes.
One.
But, I know that we, you know, as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray, there would be oh, maybe twenty, twenty-five of us because it would be all of my mother's family, you know, and all my cousins.
Oh, my goodness.
And it,
Well, now, is that hot camping.
Is that where you're, you're hot, like on a beach,
I mean, is that,
Oh, no.
Because a lot of our friends will,
We were in the, we were in the woods, you know.
Well, a lot of our friends in east, will go to east Texas in the summer and camp
and I'm thinking, how could you stand it, you know
you,
Well, we didn't notice it back then,
but that was back before air-conditioning was so you know, prevalent and all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
that's true.
We didn't,
And, uh, you know, it, it always rained on us.
I don't care what weekend, we went and when it was, it always rained on us.
But, I like that,
and see, especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up.
Cuddle up, uh-huh.
And I thought that was fun.
Well, I don't know,
I remember one time, uh, some cousins were in a tent
and, it was married cousins,
and they, they had the tent
and this, you know, frog strangler that we used to call them, came through
and they had put their tent over kind of,
I don't know what,
it wasn't a creek bed,
it was like, kind of like a little, little, uh, gully or trench or something,
Uh-huh.
and the water rushed down
and they said they looked down and there went Bud's boots
Oh, no.
and, you know There went several things floating down this water, you know.
Oh, no
We just used to have balls.
Golly
You know, it was, it was more fun.
You know, and, as I said, it just rained every time.
Well,
And then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller
and we went up there,
but it was never quite the same thing. You know.
Yeah.
Well, yeah,
I understand that, too, because some of the places we,
in fact, the, the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit, it loses it's flavor.
Yes,
yes,
it does.
So,
It really does. Uh,
Well, I've, I've gotten in the mood to go now
Yeah
Yeah,
even I would kind of like to go.
Yeah
And I know if I go home and say, oh, let's go camping, my husband says, you're crazy
I,
You're crazy
Well, listen, I enjoyed talking with you.
I enjoyed talking to you, too.
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Any vacations recently that you would highly recommend?
Well. That is like my favorite hobby
Oh, really?
So, yeah,
I would travel everywhere
and I have been all over Europe and a lot of the United States and Hawaii
Oh, wow.
and, So, when I can that is what I do
Wow.
Uh-huh.
Uh, what, what, has been your favorite trip do you think?
Well, I am not sure.
Uh, I guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places.
Really?
Yeah.
Better than Europe?
Well, no that is exciting.
You know, I have been several times
so after the first time it is like anywhere.
Oh.
You know, it loses that newness,
but yeah
I love it.
I love to go over to Europe.
I do
and mostly I travel through Germany and Switzerland
and we have good friends in England
so I have been there quite a bit
Uh-huh.
and I just love it all.
I love to look at the different people and the different cultures and
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So how about you?
Yeah.
Well, uh, I have been to Canada several times
but, uh, that is about it for me.
I, I am from Denver
Uh-huh.
and so, uh, growing up, uh, we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado.
Uh, my family is, uh, uh, real into camping and four wheeling,
and so, uh, several,
I, I, think, maybe, uh, four summers in a row, uh, we spent, uh, our vacation time in the summer, uh, four wheeling through, uh, portions of, uh, the southern half of Colorado
and, and, uh, every time, uh, my mother had, uh, uh,
I have two other sisters
and my mother had us, uh, do some studying of the, the, area which we going to visit
and then we had to write, uh reports, reports about it during, during our vacation. Which, which, was really fun.
Oh no
It was really fun.
We, we, each got to write little books.
Uh  and, uh, it had sparked an interest that, uh, of mine,
Uh-huh.
uh, my fiancee is a very very good photographer.
That is what she had originally gone to school to do. Was photography
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I, I, am close to receiving my English degree, uh, as, as, well as my, my, graduate degree,
so, so, I, uh, uh, we have thought very seriously of trying to, uh, incorporate travel into and writing a book about, uh, some portion of travel, uh,
so we are hoping soon, uh, not soon, maybe within the next ten years to get to, to take a trip over from, uh, over to Europe and take, uh, a trip from the northern portion of France uh, down to the southern tip of Spain, uh, and follow.
Uh-huh.
It is kind of a backward S shape, uh, trail that the pilgrims use to take, uh, in, in, uh, back in the medieval times, uh, to see the relics, uh, in, uh, southern Spain and in Italy
Uh-huh.
and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and Romanesque monasteries and, uh, just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it.
Right.
That would be quite a project.
Yeah,
it would be
Yeah.
uh, it, it is our big dream.
Well, it would be a lot fun.
You know, there is good and there is bad
and my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure.
But, Well, I flew into Milan.
Oh, uh,
really?
Uh-huh.
My daughter is, uh, a twirling champion
Uh-huh.
and she had to perform over there and, in Turin
and so we had to fly into Milan
and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians, even if they speak English, they do not want to let you know
Oh, sure.
and they gave us all the wrong directions
Oh.
and there were just two of us.
At the airport they put us on the wrong bus
Finally, we saw a policeman.
He put us on the subway.
Uh-huh.
We sat there, uh,
we did not know Italian.
We looked at each other.
We said things like spaghetti You know things like that.
Uh-huh.
We finally followed some kids who told us where to get off.
We followed these kids with, uh, gym bags
and we figured that must be the sports arena
Uh-huh.
and we lucked out
and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground.
I mean it was so, It was kind of a nightmare.
Wow.
But, that was our experience
and I guess all of Italy is not like that.
Right.
But where we were, it certainly was
and the hotel that we stayed in,
we stayed with our English friends, their team in the hotel
and it was beautiful.
It was very modern.
Uh-huh.
But it was very far away on a bus.
Oh.
So, you know, it was, it was really, uh, it was interesting.
You always learn something.
Yeah,
yeah.
And you always have a fun experience
so it is great. You know.
You said that you have been to England several times?
Uh-huh.
I wonder, have you ever been to a, uh, a small town, uh,
well it is actually about thirty minutes from Salisbury.
It is called, uh, Bemerton?
No,
I have not. Huh-uh.
Okay.
Our friends live like an hour outside of England, like Ash, around there.
Oh, okay.
Alright,
yeah.
So, uh-huh.
Uh, uh, the reason I am curious, I, uh,
the other place I would like to visit, uh,
I guess you heard our our topic for today was clothing?
Yes,
I certainly did.
How you dress for work and season to season and everything.
Uh-huh.
How do you dress for work?
Well, uh, uh about the same I dress for school.
I, uh, I am a graduate student
so, I don't have to worry too much about, uh, what I wear too much of the time. Which is nice.
Sure.
Uh Uh, uh, although I do, uh, a lot of,
You bet.
I am a speech pathology major
and so I do a lot of clinical work
and when I do clinic work then I have to, uh, uh, look my best.
Look professional
Yeah.
Unfortunately.
Yeah,
I understand.
I am a,
I own my company.
I am in the, I am, uh, manufactures rep sales organization
and my office is a small office
and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that
Uh-huh.
but then when I travel it is a little different situation.
Yeah,
sure.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.
Yeah,
I think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest
Uh-huh.
I will always remember,
I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college,
my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago, twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.
Uh-huh.
I worked for the, uh, Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical
and I sold uh, you know, manure.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers
and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that,
but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
Uh-huh.
And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls,
and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
Uh-huh.
and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional
Oh, really?
so, uh, it was sort of,
Even the farmers.
You bet even back then
Oh, wow.
so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best,
Uh-huh.
but here again I dress casual quite a bit
so,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
certainly.
It gives you confidence.
In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago, then I wear coat and tie.
If I call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, I might be casual.
Uh-huh.
I call on Oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be coat and tie.
So it depends.
Yeah,
it depends.
Sure.
Uh, so you don't, uh,
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?
Uh, probably no.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but then it depends on who you are calling on.
Who you're,
you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.
Uh-huh.
Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.
Right,
right.
So, it's its' just different.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that, uh,
if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh
well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.
Yes,
it is.
I am, uh, like a Catholic
and the people that go to my Church, you know
Catholics dress very casual a lot of the times.
People in jeans and in whatever,
but yet the way I was raised,
I am a converted Catholic,
the way I was raised,
I was raised a Baptist
and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time.
I guess that has changed also.
Uh-huh
Uh, yeah.
I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ.
I have been raised in the Church of Christ
and, uh, but, uh, I, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best uh, uh, and dress and proper attire
Right.
and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.
Sure.
You know, people just don't have that
and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because  they don't have the clothes to wear.
But .
That is a very good point.
I am from West Virginia
so I understand what you are saying there
Uh-huh.
and it's it's a very good point.
Yeah.
But you shouldn't, what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
Certainly.
And, uh, evaluation of an individual. Course, all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have.
I think you have to dress sort of accordingly.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.
Uh-huh.
What about season to season.
Does,
I guess your dress changes.
Uh, yeah
a little bit.
Uh, uh of course in the summer if I can get away with it, I wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts
and that's it.
Run around barefoot, no shirt or anything
But, uh,
Okay, Ron.
Okay.
Welcome to the net
and, uh, what did you do about your last auto repair,
oh, and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth.
Well, Larry, my last one, unfortunately, was a, an expensive one because I had a brand new Lincoln Town Car
and and a couple of ladies ran a stop light,
Um.
the lights weren't working properly,
it wasn't their fault,
but we, they didn't run it.
We both had green,
and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car,
so.
My goodness gracious that's,
That was a huge repair bill.
Well, that's still not enough for a total, is it.
I know,
I hated that.
It's a very expensive automobile.
So it wasn't enough to total it,
but that's my, that's been my most, uh, expensive repair probably in the last year, with the except of just service work, because I buy a new car every two years
and,
Oh, and do you buy one every two years?
Well, I travel a lot,
so you know, uh, this last one I leased,
Uh-huh.
so I don't know,
and I leased it on a twenty-four month program.
First time I've ever done that.
But I'll probably go back to buying them, because I don't care to lease them
Did this car have one of these expanding balloons,
or just are there normal safety belts in it, that you had.
No,
it has the expanding balloons.
Did that help you?
Uh, it,
they didn't go off.
They didn't go off.
No,
I guess we weren't going,
that sort of upset me,
we weren't going fast enough
when I called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it,
but, no, sir,
didn't go off, uh,
we were
it was a bad, rainy, dark, dreary day,
and, and the street lights.
But you were hit in the side, weren't you?
Yes.
That may be the problem.
You, you may, you may need to be hit from something the, leaning towards the forward to activate it.
Yes.
Took off my whole front fender and hood and everything.
I tell you, just took it all off.
My goodness.
It was uh, uh,
my doors were okay front and back
Uh-huh.
but it did, uh, right eleven thousand dollars in damage.
It was a
then I get it back and two weeks after that, I'm driving it in front of the local high school, and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me.
That's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage
My goodness.
So, I'm going to get,
when my twenty-four months is up on this car, I'm getting rid of this car.
I would think so
This doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one.
My golly.
How about you, Larry?
Well, I'm relatively fortunate about that.
Uh, here we, somehow, don't have many people run into us, although at the beginning of each school season, uh, students move into town who are from big cities,
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two, three weeks, then they finally settle down and,  realize that they don't have to drive that way here.
I understand.
And, now that takes the strain out, off of everyone that, uh, is driving a vehicle,
and I find that the most of the repairs I have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to, uh, take care of us in the winter time.
I understand.
Uh, I have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac, so forth,
and I have to,
and I drive a Honda most of the time,
and like hand over the telephone I have to make sure that, uh, salt and so forth are kept off of it,
and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away.
Sure.
I understand that because I'm from West Virginia,
and we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow.
Uh-huh.
Well, I just, I I had this Cougar totally, uh, the body of it, totally rebuilt, uh, to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders uh, done, and then it all repainted,
and then winter got here
and so I put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off,
like hand over the telephone so I haven't had a chance to drive it very much
But, anyhow, uh, now, are you going to buy this next car
or you going rent it, lease it again?
No,
I'm going to, I'm going to buy it, Larry,
I don't like the rental,
I think, I'm getting ready to retire myself,
and I'm going to, I'm going to be, you know, driving a car for longer,
Are you?
so, I usually drive a car for three years,
and and anyway, and so, but last couple of cars I've only driven for two years,
Uh-huh.
and so I'd leased this one for two years.
So I'll probably go back and buy one,
and, uh, this next car will probably be my retirement car.
Well, that's an awfully big one, that, uh, that one that you had, that Lincoln, uh,
isn't it too large for normal town driving, finding parking places  and getting in and out the doors?
Well, no sir.
Not really,
not really
Uh-huh.
uh, no problem at all.
My wife and daughter,
we have, uh, two Toyotas in the family, one Nissan,
and then we have the Lincoln
and the
not really,
no problem there at all as as far as finding parking places,
it's it's convenient in that, in that regard.
Well, that certainly would be a wonderful, comfortable machine to take on long trips
Yes,
it is.
And I and I travel,
I'm, I'm very much aware of that.
I'm like a traveling salesman,
don't travel a lot any more,
but, uh, when I do take it, it is very comfortable to drive.
Yes,
I'm sure it is, because that's the way that I enjoy this Pontiac that I have.
Yes
it's,
It only has thirty-eight thousand miles on it,
but it's  very quiet and very smooth riding machine.
Is that right?
Well, my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old,
it only has, doesn't even have thirty thirty thousand miles on it,
so, gosh, been much, in such good shape, that'll probably be an eight or ten year car.
Uh-huh.
Do you, do you feel that, uh,
Uh, I don't know.
My personal perception of government and, uh, the way things are at this current time, is that nobody can really be trusted.
And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to, uh, be self-serving to the community.
I think that they have their own, uh, wishes to, uh, be in the limelight and to kind of say, hey, you know, I'm a public official, I don't have to do, uh, certain things
and they just stand out more. Involving themselves more and more with politics
but it's really,
after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts, uh, of checks, uh, before that it was the wonderful, uh, escapade that they had with, uh, the new, uh, oh God , chief of, uh,
well Supreme Court,
I'm trying to think of his name and, uh, what they put, uh, him through in regards to,
Thomas?
Yeah,
Thomas.
Uh-huh.
The sex, sexual harassment, that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that.
I, I just think it's very corrupt and in whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor, and send them into government versus people that are rich.
But it's always the rich person that gets into government. That has the money to advertise, the money to to do this.
There's no more Abe, Abraham Lincolns out there, uh, that can get into government, even if they were poor.
So, I know that's my personal viewpoint of things.
Doesn't Wisconsin have a, uh, state, uh, Medicare program or health program?
Now, they just, uh, they've already put through the health bill
Yes.
It just went through
and it was passed
and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical.
Uh, I don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people.
You know what I'm saying?
It, it's,
right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health, uh, system
and, of course, they think, uh, Wisconsin, our or Minnesota, our neighbor, passed a state law, the health bill
and it's kind of like we're the first to do it.
So, I don't know if it's done because we're, we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for, uh, you know, a real good purpose to help people that can't afford, uh, health insurance, that kind of thing.
Right.
Well, I, I think the, one of the biggest problems that, uh, we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself.
Uh-huh.
Oh, sure.
And that is, uh, uh, we become so debt ridden and credit oriented instead of, uh, cash and carry or debt free
Oh, sure.
Uh-huh.
and therefore, uh, that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities, state and federal governments.
It, it sure does.
And  I think it, it is reflecting.
Like you said I think society as a whole, uh, you can't expect, uh,
when we have T V and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for, uh, you know, immorality and this and this and this, that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean, totally clean And come into government.
Right.
Uh, but down the line it does hurt.
I mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something, it's, uh, you know, it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or, you know, the other things that have occurred,
so, uh,
Well, what is,
see the thing is, is when a lot of things become acceptable practice uh, it's hard to discern the what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical.
Uh-huh.
And then  someone blows the whistle and says, oh, this is not ethical and yes I did it too.
Exactly.
Yeah
Well, that's exactly what happens in government all the time.
They blow the whistle on each other.
Oh, I hear that you're doing this,
I've done it
but oh boy,
and it's not going to get out.
yeah,
exactly. It's, uh,
there's no  secrets in the government. Uh  I don't think anymore.
Yeah,
we just had,
Uh.
Right.
The mayor of Dallas is, uh, Bartlett, Steve Bartlett.
Uh-huh.
He also, uh, was a congressman. Uh, to the, uh, to Congress.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And he had been in that position for years.
Sure.
And, uh, he was elected mayor of Dallas overwhelmingly.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
However, if the vote was taken today, the whole thing might change because he was part of that, uh, check kiting scam
Oh, sure.
I think, I, I don't think, uh
Oh, go ahead
I, I am glad to talk to an expert.
I always wanted to know who an expert was.
Oh, well, I'm not an expert,
I just had a little, I've, I've seen a little pollution in my time.
It's, uh,
the, the chemicals we were dealing with were, uh, a Raid repellent
and, uh, that was really quite dangerous,
I'm not certain that that was,
that, that's really a pollution issue.
I think pollution issue is, is, uh, is, is the argument over, over people catching, uh, things like, uh, respiratory disease.
Uh, well, there, there's two things, uh,
the one I'm interested the most, I guess, myself, uh, would be the, the Freons I mean , for air
the one, I guess, that's the one I'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning.
That seemed to be the biggest surprise to me
and whether,
when they replace it, you know, they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad.
Well, the, you know,
that, that's another arguable issue
and I, I've seen the, uh, uh, uh,
assuming you can buy into global warming I
Yeah,
I, uh, was, uh, you know,
where they were all concerned about that,
but that, that it seems to be,
Well, did you see Carl Sagan on SIXTY MINUTES on, uh, when he was talking about when if, if the, if the war started in, in Kuwait and they'd set those, uh, all
No,
I heard about it though.
uh, it was, it was, it was interesting
but, uh, I'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit.
Was that before,
I didn't see it,
was that before they actually did that
or it was
Yes.
And his argument was, uh, was that, that you would see a, uh, a year with no summer.  Which actually happened.
Because of that,  you know.
And it, it
yes,
it actually happened,
uh, it was a volcano erupted
and it was high enough up
but, uh, they had some people from the national meteorological center I think it was which is the national, anyway, research people
and they said that the, uh, that the pollution would not go high enough.
And it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars,  may have once made a mistake,
Right.
but the, the the general, the opinion among, among the, uh, meteorologists at, uh,
