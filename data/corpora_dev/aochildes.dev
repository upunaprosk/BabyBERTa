lots of books .
ah books !
what book is that ?
lulu .
norman the doorman ?
you wanna read norman ?
norman .
okay .
okay .
in front of a small well hidden hole .
around and back of the majestic museum of art there once stood a mouse named !
norman ?
norman was a doorman .
he greeted all the art loving creatures .
she's wearing a dress .
you're right ?
you're right .
oh i think he's wearing a lil scarf ?
on his neck .
he greeted all the art loving creatures .
who came to see the treasures ?
which were kept in the basement of the museum ?
come right in norman would say .
a lil scarf .
and a dress ?
right .
right a scarf .
we're quite safe said norman i sprung all the traps .
oo what do you see ?
a bust .
we saw a white bust in the museum here right .
norman would explain every painting in detail .
and handle each masterpiece masterpiece with as much care .
a sad clown and a statue you're right .
he handled each masterpiece with as much care and respect as if he had painted it himself .
he would also take great pride in pointing out the artistic features of certain pieces of greek sculpture ?
which rested in the dark corners of the storage room .
she is wearing quite a snazzy dress i think .
as oh we missed a page .
norman's only worry was keeping out of sight of the sharp eyed upstairs guard .
who often came to the basement to set traps for mice ?
his bright flashlight frightened the visitors .
i know they're running away from the guard .
yeah .
as for norman he always managed to escape ?
and hide inside an old armored knights helmet ?
up there he felt perfectly safe .
actually the helmet was norman's home .
which he had made into a very comfortable and workable studio .
just see what a splendid sky light the visor made ?
like most everybody norman had a hobby ?
each night after work he tried to create something pleasing or beautiful ?
perhaps a painting of swiss cheese and crackers or a statue .
one bitter cold day norman decided to stay in his studio and make something out of wire ?
i know he's making something out of wire .
it's a mouse trap .
he took it apart ?
and he's taking the wire off of it to make a sculpture right .
right .
he made a trapeze ?
that's right ?
all through the day and far into the night norman twisted and bent wires into many strange and mysterious shapes .
until at last he created something he was really proud of ?
it looked for all the world like a mouse on a trapeze .
oh yes .
that night when he finally went to sleep he was a tired but happy mouse .
early next morning when norman went outside to shovel away snow in front of his doorway .
he noticed a man reading a sign nearby .
he read the sign to .
sculpture contest ?
open to all artists great and small .
last day today .
back he flew .
why can't i show my wire statue he said .
as he slid through the visor opening .
but what would he call it ?
all pieces must have a title he well knew .
suddenly he had an inspiration .
stripping off the printed word trap from the label and ripping off the letters eese from the word cheese he pasted them together .
trapeze .
now he had a fitting title for his wire work ?
although norman was a modest mouse he practically burst a button off his coat .
then as this was the last day for artists to bring their sculpture pieces .
norman put a cover over his statue as he .
there the mouse is hiding there under the cover .
yeah away he scooted ?
up the snowy staircase he climbed .
once inside the huge museum he eagerly followed the other sculptors from one room to another .
he still had to be extremely careful of the guard ?
there's a bust you're right .
the other bust is sad ?
yes ?
the accordion right .
you're right .
it's an accordion ?
what's this ?
is that a statue of a woman dancing ?
yeah .
she looks like she's having a good time .
don't you think .
yes .
and there's a statue of a man riding a horse .
and a statue of a lil boy and girl holding a balloon .
after carefully removing the cover from his wire statue he left it on the floor with the rest of the contestants work ?
out he went into the snowy afternoon knowing he had done his best ?
you see he had not forgotten he was a doorman who had a job to do ?
she is wearing a dress ?
what color is her dress ?
oh another dress .
wow .
two dresses what color are they ?
yellow and pink .
meanwhile upstairs in the sculpture gallery of the museum .
the judges were busy judging .
oh .
there it is .
quietly and seriously they examined each piece ?
trying to find which ones deserved prizes ?
gradually they found themselves huddled around a certain statue ?
now this is an amazing creation exclaimed one .
there's no name and isn't it a shame it's so tiny .
yes but remember the contest is open to great and small ?
one by one each guard when asked if he had knew who had brought it in shook his head and said no not i ?
the museum director couldn't understand why none of them had caught sight of the artist ?
but when the sharp eyed guard took a closer look he gasped .
so this is where my mouse traps have been going ?
i think i know where to start looking for that tricky trap snatcher ?
and without waiting another minute the guard snapped on his flash light and hurried downstairs to the basement ?
what's this one of my traps stuck in a knights helmet ?
he lifted up the visor to investigate ?
there inside he saw pieces of wire and parts of traps ?
and strangest of all a neat straw bed which could only belong to a mouse .
whoever he is he must be very find of my cheese said the guard ?
during all this time norman had been tending to his duty as a doorman .
a party of mice from the country for whom he had be waiting ?
was long passed due ?
and he was getting mighty cold and hungry ?
but to his surprise who should come around the corner but the sharp eyed guard ?
there you are said the guard as norman fled inside ?
but when the guard held a piece of cheese above the hole norman sniffed it ?
he couldn't help poking his nose out to get a better whiff ?
and just as he was about to reach up and snatch the cheese a hand came around swiftly and caught norman by the tail .
are you the rascal who's been taking my mouse traps everyday and using them for artistic purposes asked the guard .
it's just my hobby said norman ?
it's just my hobby ?
oh there having a big party ?
the guard tossed norman up on his shoulder .
norman was sure he was being taken to jail .
you can imagine his surprise when instead they entered the museum and heard the artist all clapping and cheering hooray for trapeze ?
hooray for trapeze .
why i'll be bamboozled cried the guard ?
i do believe you've won a prize ?
the guard rushed right up to the judges platform and said proudly .
here's the winner i found him freezing in the snow ?
indeed said the head judge ?
why yes who else would could have created the daring mouse on the trapeze .
what is your name my good fellow ?
and what would you like for your prize .
if you please sir my name is norman ?
and i'm the doorman downstairs ?
and i've always dreamed of seeing the upstairs of the museum without getting caught .
that's what i'd like best ?
there's a bust .
and another bust ?
and that's that's a knight with his armor on .
yes ?
the guard led norman out into the hall ?
where together they began a grand tour of the entire art museum ?
later that night when norman returned from returned to his door .
he found his mice friends from the country waiting for him ?
of course norman invited them in where he shared with them an enormous slice of cheese ?
a present given to him from the warm hearted guard ?
what a wonderful way to end the day .
good night .
yay ?

did we see any bears .
what kind of bears ?
polar bears .
and what about what was the black bear called .
who was very chilly ?
and sleeping .
the moon bear right ?
and did we see any other animals .
any big animals ?
like what .
she is wearing a dress .
another dress .
lily is very obsessed with dresses these days .
and another dress .
oh my gosh they're all wearing dresses .
well i think that's a lil boy wearing pants and a shirt .
oo what's that .
that looks just like a globe .
daddy's favorite is the globe ?
daddy does like globes .
oh .
donuts yummy .
yummy .
maybe we'll go get something to eat when we go to the mall later .
what do you like to eat at the mall ?
what does mommy like to eat at the mall ?
coffee mommy likes to get coffee at the mall .
and mommy likes those pretzels to doesn't she .
you like donuts ?
this is like my dad use to say like when he takes out his slide shows from when he was like thirteen .
he goes oh look ah all those people !
dead dead dead .
oh she's dead .
he should be dead if he's not .
dead dead dead i'm like .
it's like lily dress dress dress dress dress next page ?
dress dress dress ?
exactly .
boys should be wearing dresses too .
dress dress dress .
oo boy what's he cooking .
what does that look like to you ?
hot dogs .
yummy .
so did i tell you manuela .
that there you know they come up with all this information now about tuna ?
that women of child bearing age shouldn't eat more than a certain amount of tuna because it has mercury in it .
and so pregnant women or people planning to get pregnant shouldn't eat that much tuna and young children and whatever .
so she loves it .
so um although not with mayonnaise ?
only eats tuna in olive oil .
like she eats italian tuna in olive oil and salt .
i know .
oh she wearing a dress too .
so i called i kept meaning to ask the pediatrician and i forgot to ask her when we were there for our two year appointment ?
so i called one day and it's a big practice .
and you know a bunch of doctors running around ?
told her i was a patient of dr louis i was wondering if you could ask .
yes sweetie pie .
okay sweetie mommy has hondo and fabian to if you wanna read it .
oh .
you wanna read that one ?
okay .
oh i'm sorry angel .
i'm sorry .
did i just scratch your lil nose .
can i kiss it .
does that feel better .
oh good .
so i call up and i said can you ask if there's does the practice have any guide lines as to how much tuna a kid can eat ?
because she wants everyday for lunch can we have tuna .
so i've only been i've been trying to give it to her once a week ?
and she'll eat like a three ounce can .
but even that i'm like it's so hard to wait a whole week to give it to her because she wants it .
wow .
and um so i called and the woman's like okay i'll ask like you're crazy !
she gets back on the phone she goes dr lang said one to two ounces a week like that's like two bites an ounce .
i know .
so the woman goes my son eats tuna everyday ?
so this is what they're recommending for that an adult female shouldn't have like should have a can because a big a regular size can of tuna is six ounces .
yeah .
so they said a grown woman can have a can of tuna a week and young kids are suppose to have one to two .
i know .
i eat it too .
i eat so much tuna .
i know .
i mean i think it's only related to pregnancy .
and young kids but i guess the mercury will affect brain development .
potentially ?
you know they said canned tuna has less than fresh tuna it's really i guess it's tuna and swordfish that your suppose to cut back on .
but one to two if they're really suggesting one to two ounces a week i can't believe that they don't hand this out on a flyer to people .
she would literally eat it everyday if she could .
i know literally the small the tiny can with the flip ?
top that you'll buy for lunch that comes with crackers or whatever .
that's three ounces and it's like this big tiny .
so they're saying this for adult pregnant woman ?
right or anyone who can potentially become pregnant ?
right .
what would you like sweetie ?
you can climb under and get it ?
oh you're looking for something want me to move the camera .
i can move it for you .
i don't know what she's looking for actually .

you want some juice or some water .
n'kay ?
okay ?

i was afraid of that .
when you eat salty cheese like that all by itself especially if you're really hungry that can happen ?
use both hands please .
good job .
you want juice .
okay .
i'll get you some .
very slowly and carefully with that please .
let me call .

four two eight six nine three three .
put what back .
how are you ?

how was your trip ?

uh three thirty or four .

now .
if it's hurting now from the kiwi that probably means it will hurt if you get tomato sauce on it .

you can chew some but it's not quite ready yet .
just needs another minute .

i'm gonna cool down the .
spaghetti by putting it in the pasta .
whoa that's too much for you isn't it ?
i'm trying to cool down the pasta by putting it in the cold spaghetti sauce .
it will make the spaghetti cool enough to eat .
i think he says zoom when he comes down the chimney .
this might be hot .
let's just wait a minute and see ?
um it's just warm .
i think that's okay for you to eat .
do you want some more salty cheese ?
or not .
you want it over here or on top of your pasta .
i think mommy's gonna sit and eat with you too ?
is that a good spoon for what you're eating ?
mommy's very very hungry too ?
i'm gonna eat pasta with salty cheese .
and tomato sauce just like you are ?
think i'm gonna heat up my tomato sauce .
in a little container .
let me get a paper towel .

yeah ?
just chew that spaghetti up nice .
and here's some juice if you wanna drink it .
i'll put it over here .

and the stove .
electricity is good for machines .
running machines .

you are very right ?
and this orange truck is doing something very different that i've never seen .
in this book before ?
what is the orange truck doing ?
it looks like that .
i think you're right .
i think it's kind of sand going pouring into this truck .
i think this kind of sand is probably concrete for the street .
this is probably how they make the street ?
that's a lot of farm animals .
i used to have this when i was a little girl do you know that .
i used to have this .
this exact toy .
me too everybody did .
that's right .
and you know what i used to do .
i used to keep all of my animals inside this silo .
that's what this is called a silo .
mhm .
that's what i used to do ?
oh sure ?
oh i can move it and make it more comfortable for you if you'd like ?
why is it bugging you .
it is .
can we keep it on a little bit longer do you think .
so we can keep making those tapes ?

cleaning what .
yeah why do you think she had to do that .
was she very nice to us ?
did she talk to us ?
do you remember what she said ?
i don't remember .
you know she probably told us to be careful right .
so why .
because she didn't want us to to what .
i don't remember .
we were supposed to be careful on the stairs .
because she was cleaning them and she didn't want us to .
yeah probably .
yeah .
i think you're right .
because sometimes you know when things get wet they get really slippery .

as they were walking along tupty saw a beautiful red flower and stopped to pick it .
as she bended down puddy pushed away the blankets and jumped out of the carriage very quickly and quietly so tupty didn't see him tupty turned around and oh her puddy was gone .
she got so worried ?

and the boy who's playing the policeman says .
oh she's right over there .
she points he points to puddy .
and tupty is very relieved .
mhm ?
but that's only part of the problem .
cause they found where puddy is but they still don't have her back .

and the policeman runs through the pipe .
and tupty runs through the pipe !

i think maybe they're gonna have some chicks .
so they need to have a nice nest to live in .
so they're trying to figure out where's a good place to build our nest .
well you wouldn't wanna build a nest in a bad place .
you wouldn't wanna build a nest in someone's bath room .
you wouldn't wanna build a nest right on a street would you .
because it wouldn't be safe .
let see what happens to them .
hm .
well what else would be a bad place to build a nest .
let's ask let see if bird children know the answer to that question ?
well i wouldn't wanna build a nest right near some foxes .
and i wouldn't wanna live in a nest where there wasn't any food near by .
and i wouldn't wanna build a nest next to a play ground where there're lots of noisy children all the time .
i wouldn't build a nest in a refrigerator .
it will be to cold .
because that's what birds really speak .
i wouldn't wanna build to build a nest near a camera .
why naima .
why .
oh i wouldn't wanna build a nest right next to a bear .
that would be scary .
i wouldn't wanna build a nest on an airplane .
i definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a cat .
i definitely wouldn't wanna build a nest near a dog yikes yikes yikes ?
that's right dogs barking is loud and the birds might get annoyed by the dogs barking ?
that would be an a noisy annoying noise for the birds wouldn't it .
near a duck .
why not .
duck is just another bird .
may be it'll be okay to build a nest near a duck .
should we read the rest of the story ?
hey that's the same did you hear the noise out there .
is the same noise that carmen makes that must of been a cardinal .
i think carmen is do you hear that .
i think they're talking to each other cardinal must be carmen must be talking to the other cardinal that are outside .
what a nice bird ?
hm okay ?
oh they're going fishing here they're looking for fish to eat in this pond .
and here they see the swan boats .
see the swan ?
these are called the swan boats .
and here are the children riding bicycles the birds better watch out .
those ducks better watch out so the bicycles don't run them over .
oh my goodness they almost ran them right over .
hm so they flew over beacon hill around the state house but there was no place there .
they looked in lewisburg square but there was no water to swim in .
oh that's where they gonna oh they found an island and that's where they going to build a hah look at that there's their nest .
who's that ?
oops .
those are teenager birds .
well it just needs to be close to your mouth that's all .
because it's it's recording your voice .
is that what you want them to here .
okay ?
is that like what a baby says .
but they wanna know about what a toddler say ?
is that what a baby or toddler says .
toddler .
that's his name .
hah look at that what do they have in the nest ?
one two three four five six seven eight there're eight eggs in the nest .
hah and pretty soon they hatch and they have eight chicks ?
ducklings really those are ducklings .
what do you think the mama duck says to the ducklings ?
their children .
because the bicycle the person on the bicycle didn't realize that there were ducks in the way ?
here're the ducks they're growing up and getting bigger now they're kinda like toddler ducks .
oh the mommy still takes care of them .
she's teaching them how to swim and dive .
that's how they get around they swim and that's how they look for food in the water ?
here they're they're lining up .
she's teaching them to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels .
that's kind of like when i tell you have be careful in the parking lot .
and that cars are dangerous she's she's teaching them the same thing she's saying cars and bicycles and other things on wheels are dangerous cause they can bump into you .
that's just what mommy taught you naima .

old stone wall .
right ?
in that wall not far from the barn and the granary a chatty field of .
a chatty family of field mice had their ?
home .
but the farmers had moved away the barn was abandoned and the granary stood empty .
since winter was not far off the little mice began to gather corn and nuts and wheat and straw .

the winter days are long and many and we'll run out of things to say ?

right ?
they were a happy family .
but little by little they had nibbled up most of the nuts and berries the straw was gone ?
oh yes yes it is .
the corn was only a memory .
it was cold in the wall and no one felt like chatting ?
aw ?
well they're inside the stones of the wall .
well it's all around that's part of the wall right here .
right here .
right .
you think they're kind of sad .
then they remembered what frederick had said about sun rays and colors and words ?
what about your supplies frederick they asked ?
close your eyes said frederick as he climbed onto a big stone ?
now i send you the rays of the sun ?
do you feel how their golden glow ?
and as frederick spoke of the sun the four little mice began to feel warmer .
was it frederick's voice .
was it magic ?
and how about the colors frederick they asked anxiously .
close your eyes again frederick said and when he told them of the blue periwinkles the red poppies and the yellow wheat and the green leaves of the berry bush they saw the colors as clearly as if they had been painted in their minds .
right and purple .
you're squeezing the colors in your hands ?
you're mushing the colors up into your hands ?
wow .
and the words frederick ?
frederick cleared his throat and then as if from a stage he said ?
who scatters the snowflakes who melts the ice ?
who grows the four leaf clovers in june ?
who dims the daylight who lights the ?
four little field mice who live in the sky .
four little field mice like .
one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers then comes the summer who paints in the .
the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat and winter is last with little ?
aren't we lucky the seasons are four .

here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air .
gospal in the hospital .
last year i was gospal the dog walker .
when our neighbors went on vacation i walked their dogs ?
and guess what i bought with the money they gave me !
a key chain with a little ?
what ?
race car yes .
what's this thing ?
a ramp .
hm i thought it might be gospal's shadow .
well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it .
yeah .
ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow .
every one at school wanted it but it was mine .
i was scared that some one would steal it well i'm not dumb i knew a perfect place to hide it i put the key chain in my .
mouth oh oh .
what happens to him ?
he does .
what do you think the teacher is trying to do ?
what blue thing ?
that's the bench that they're sitting on .
what do you think the teacher is trying to do ?
because because he's sick .
he swallowed something .
oh dear ?
the teacher called an ambulance .
there it is .
the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but i still didn't want to tell .
oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain ?
they just know that he's very sick ?
it was a little hard to explain why i put a key chain in my mouth .
i hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here .
mhm .
what do you think that is ?
not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room .
that's the special water going into patient's body ?
you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember .
okay what happens next i had a big room all to myself ?
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me .
don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt ?
but i was still little scared specially when she took me to the x ray room .
do you remember getting x rays ?
you might not remember you did get x rays couple of times .
that's his x ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there .
poor little guy ah ?
the doctors asked him to count to ten of course i said ?
can you count ?
one .
two .
three .
i'm reading the story ?
they were right i didn't feel a thing when i woke up it was already night .
my parents were right there and mom gave me a great big .
i think you're right ?
inside was a race car so big i would never be able to swallow it ?
that's the end of the story .
again ?
yeah ?
i think you might be finished on the potty there ?
you do .
did you do more poop in there !
can i look .
you just want me to read the book more but i'll read the book more after you get off the potty !
oh boy .
maybe we should call daddy and see if he's coming home .
well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic ?
why don't we give daddy a call .
you wanna take off that sticker ?
that's the price sticker ?
that's to tell people how much the book cost .
you need your hair elastic fixed .
well that you took off the whole sticker .
that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book .
hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight .
we could do that .
yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time .
alright one more time and then i think you done on the potty .
i don't think you're peeing or pooping are you .
ah all this is is the title of the book gospal in the hospital !
last summer i was gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation i walked their dogs .
and guess what i bought with the money they gave me .
did he buy dog food .
no did he buy did he buy a chompo bar .
hm did he .
did he buy a tricycle .
oh a key chain with a little race car !
everyone at school wanted it but it was mine .
he's in school he's an animal who goes to school !
i was scared that someone would steal it well i'm not dumb i knew the perfect place to hide it i put the key chain in my mouth ?
but gulp oh no i swallowed it ?
i think he did gulp it .
oh my god .
oh you think he chewed it ?
oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though ?
suddenly i felt very sick ?
he really doesn't feel well .
what happened gospal said the teacher but i didn't answer i was afraid to tell her about my key chain ?
i think he's may be embarrassed .
well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key chain .
she called an ambulance ?
the ambulance put me on a stretcher .
this is the stretcher .
they asked me what happened but i still didn't want to tell ?
it was a little hard to explain why i put a key chain in my mouth .
well that's a good question i don't know i guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much .
they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people .
see there he's on the stretcher they're carrying him in ?
ah let see .
this is the special water .
it's a i v fluid .
called i v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it .
that's a patient .
that's the patient's bed !
yes i think you're right ?
the people who go to the hospital usually are sick .
mm .
i was a little scared that's what this page says !
they saw what i swallowed .
well it's no fun to be in the hospital .
they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna go in and take the key chain out of his belly .
they were right i didn't feel a thing when i woke up it was already night .
my parents were right there what's that ?
it's a great big package .
it could be a bath tub .
do you think it's a bath tub ?
it could be an apple tree .
do you think it's an apple tree ?
you're probably right .
it could be ten pairs of pants .
what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story .
and i think it's time .
stand up please .
what a changa cho !
what is a changa cho ?
is that right .

when we were at craigville beach ?
we saw a i don't know what you call it a special kind of truck for beaches .
it was actually it was scooping up the sand in this part of it .
and then it was putting it through like a sieve almost and it was taking all the garbage out of the sand and also flattening the sand .
it was kinda like a road roller for the beach .
do you remember that ?
that was one time when we were at craigville beach .
there's a car is there a truck at the beach today ?
this is a pickup truck .
you know there might be a couple of other uh beach magnets in your room ?
somewhere although i don't know where exactly .

and pretty soon they'll build walls .
around all four sides .
one two three four .
they're going to build four walls .
one along this edge .
one along this edge .
one along this edge .
and one along this edge and then it will be a building .
did you know that buildings usually have .
a regular building usually has four walls .
if it's square .
that's a square isn't it .
or maybe it's a rectangle .
i think that's more like a rectangle ?

a long time ago .
i believe that that is a song by johnathan richmond and the modern lovers .

floating on his chair in the water like that .

you can stay in the doorway while i go and get them .
you can't come out without shoes and socks on .

naima stay in the house .
naima .

the name of the book ?
which letters .
do you wanna use the magnetic letters or the block letters ?
are there letter stickers in that book ?
you mean these letters you wanna match ?
okay ?
i don't remember that there ?
oh right right right i know what you're talking about .
the words that are in blue .
okay we could do that .
there was lots to do arthur gave kate a ride in a little fire truck .
the words fire truck are in blue .
so can you find any pictures of a fire truck .
in the page of stickers .
i don't see a fire truck there ?
hm ?
maybe some stickers are missing .
okay .
alright well i don't see the fire truck that one is missing ?
because i haven't found that one .
i think maybe you used the stickers for something else .
let's see this is apples or strawberries right .
that's the word puppy in blue and i see a sticker that has ?
puppy .
p u p p y .
for example this does not belong here .
and there's shoes i bet there's a blue word shoes somewhere let's look for a blue word because there's a pair of shoes .
hm .
s h o e s you can put those right on that word .
yep .
back at the street fair the clown with balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes .
crash down he went .
and as he fell he let go of his balloons .
then guess what a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings .
that's in blue .
with his teeth that's also in blue .
do we have a sticker that has strings or teeth .
i see teeth .
a teeth sticker ?
do you see it ?
we need a tissue .
ooh you see the teeth sticker ?
no actually these are the teeth look ?
that's a teeth sticker .
oh where's that word .
teeth .
what letter do you think teeth begins with ?
what letter do you think that is ?
yes t very good ?
there you go ?
that's where teeth is and it does begin with letter t .
okay let's look for another word .
that .
that is in blue .
let's see .
start at the back this time .
that's the word one .
the number one .
and that's the number .
that's the .
ah word red .
well i don't know .
i don't see a sticker that has .
maybe .
yeah maybe it's somewhere else .
you did .
okay .
i'll just look through the book and see if there's any stickers that are ?
see .
that goes on the word one .
and the sentence is when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon .
very good naima .
one .
hey .
is that an arthur sticker .
oh my gosh .
you put it right on top of arthur ?
um let's find more blue words .
some of them we've already done .
red we're still looking for something that's red .
all the blue words are covered up already there .
we need strings .
somewhere there's a sticker that should be a picture of strings .
hm .
hm .
oh there's lots of blue words here .
uh arthur passed the ring toss table .
i think there's a picture of a ring right .
didn't i find that .
here we go ?
what letter do you think that word begins with ?
ring .
ring ?
can you guess ?
very good r .
that's where the word ring is ?
see there's a lower case r that starts the word .
put the ring right there .
r i n g .
ring .
let's see what else .
oh .
yeah i think actually a bunch of these things go there ?
arthur passed the ring toss table .
yep .
and there's the word table .
right there .
and there's a sticker for table .
table .
can you find the word again ?
great .
arthur passed the ring toss table ?
the bob for apples table .
the word apples is in blue .
apple .
do you know what letter that begins with ?
apple .
ah ?
very good naima right there .
that's where the word apples is .
and you're right it begins with a .
and a table with pumpkin pies .
that word .
that's actually two words pumpkin pies .
but there's only one sticker do you see a picture of pumpkin pies .
i don't think you've ever seen pumpkin pie .
that's what it looks like ?
and take this .
okay put it right on the pumpkin pies .
pumpkin pies .
what word begins with p ?
yeah .
right here see ?
pumpkin pies .
good ?
chocolate cakes and cookies .
uhthese are the cakes .
pictures of cakes .
and the word .
what letter do you think cakes begins with ?
that's a very good guess .
because both c and k make the sound kuh ?
but for cakes it's actually c not k .
see that begins with letter c .
that's the word cakes .
but you're right kuh sometimes is made by letter k .
let's see .
what else do we want here ?
yeah i've .
see these stickers we could probably put them where they belong instead ?
hey and i see the color red which was on that page where the balloon is .
hold on to this sticker .
and i tape it off and give it to you .
okay do you remember there was a page .
where the color red ?
yes .

arthur's lost puppy .

arthur and d w took baby kate to the street fair .
pal came along too ?
there was lots to do .
arthur gave kate a ride in a little fire truck .
that went around and around .
d w got her face painted .
look kate she said .
i'm a cat .
but kate was looking at something else .
suddenly kate began to cry .
are you hungry asked arthur .
here's your bottle .
but kate did not want her bottle .
wa wa wa she cried .
do you have a wet diaper asked d w ?
but kate's diaper was dry .
and still she cried .
wa wa wa .
um .
arthur lifted the baby from her stroller .
he rocked her in his arms .
he tickled her tummy .
he made funny faces but still she cried .
wa wa wa .
kate loves ice cream says arthur .
run to the store d w .
and get a .
get her a cone .
because these are stickers that don't really belong here .
we can use them for something else .
let's see .
d w tied pal's leash to a bench .
and went into the store .
a clown with balloons walked by .
pal barked at him .
woof woof woof .
when d w came out of the store pal was gone ?
she looked up and down the street .
that dog is trouble .
she cried .
and she ran to tell arthur .
oh no cried arthur why would pal run away .
maybe he's mad at you said d w .
you yelled at him today for chewing your slippers ?
arthur said nothing .
he just looked very sad .
but kate had a lot to say .
wa wa wa wa she cried .
then arthur said d w take kate home maybe she needs a doctor .
and i need to find pal he began calling .
here pal here pal .
here pal here pal .
arthur passed the ring toss table the bob for apples table and a table with pumpkin pies chocolate cakes and cookies .
he wished there was a table with hamburgers .
pal would be sure to be hanging around it .

oh thank you said arthur and he ran to the school .
but the lost puppy was not pal .
arthur sadly walked home .
back at the street fair the clown with the balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes .
crash .
down he went .
and as he fell he let go of his balloons .
then .
guess what .
a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings with his teeth .
do you wanna blow your nose ?
the balloons rose higher and higher .
over the ?
roofs .
over the .
trees and up up up they went .
and so did pal .
look someone shouted .
a flying puppy .
a flying puppy .
do puppies have wings naima .
what has wings ?

puppies don't ?
you wanna nurse ?
um okay .
and ?
then suddenly bang pop bang the balloons hit a tall tree .
one by one they burst .
pal floated slowly down .
when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon ?
and one was all he needed .
to make baby kate happy .
um .
um .

horton hatches the egg ?
sighed maisy a lazy bird hatching an egg ?
i'm tired and i'm bored and i've kinks in my .
from sitting just sitting here day after day .
it's work how i hate it i'd much rather .
i'd take a vacation fly off for a rest .
if i could find someone to stay on my ?
if i could find someone i'd fly away free .
then horton the elephant passed by her .
hello called the lazy bird smiling her best .
you've nothing to do and i do need a .
would you like sit on the egg in my nest .
the elephant laughed why of all silly things i haven't feathers and i haven't .
me on your egg why that doesn't make sense your egg is so small maam and i'm so .
big .
huge .
gigantic .
your egg is so small maam and i'm so .
immense .
tut tut answered maisy i know you're not small but i'm sure you can do it .
sweetie can you help mommy .
please ?

honey ?
you're gonna help yourself okay .
very nice honey !
all different colors .
another colorful springtime day ?
hooray ?

just sit on it softly you're gentle and kind .
come be a good fellow i know you won't mind .
i can't said the elephant please begged the bird i won't be gone long sir i give you my word .
i'll hurry right back why i'll never be missed .
very well said the elephant since you .
insist !
you want a vacation go fly off and take it i'll sit on your egg and i'll try not to break it !
i'll stay and be faithful i mean what i say ?
toodleloo sang out maisy and fluttered away .
hm .
first thing to do murmured horton let's see .
first thing to do is to prop up this tree .
and make it much stronger that has to be done .
before i get on it i must weigh a .
right .
he weighs a .
he must weight a ton .
and that's a lot .
then carefully tenderly gently he crept .
up the trunk to the nest where the little egg .
slept .
and horton the elephant smiled now that's that .
and he sat and he sat and he sat and he .
and he sat all that day and he kept the egg warm and he sat all that night through a terrible storm .
it poured and it lightninged it thundered and rumbled .
this isn't much fun the poor elephant grumbled .
i wish she'd come back because i'm cold and i'm wet .
i hope that that maisy bird doesn't .
right .
but maisy by this time was far beyond reach .
enjoying the sunshine way off in .
right .
and having such fun such a wonderful rest .
decided she'd never go back to her .
right that's not very nice is it .
no that's why she's a lazy lazy bird .
so horton kept sitting there day after day and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away .
and then came the winter the snow and sleet .
and icicles hung from his trunk and his .
ah .
you're right .
but horton kept sitting and said with a sneeze .
i'll stay on this egg and i won't let it ?
right .
i meant what i said and i said what i meant an elephant's faithful .
one hundred percent .
right .
he's very faithful and he's taking care of that egg !
right !
make sure it's okay .
so poor horton sat there the whole winter through .
and then came the spring time with troubles anew .
his friends gathered round and shouted with glee .
look horton the elephant's up in a tree !
they taunted and teased and they yelled how absurd !
old horton the elephant thinks he's a .
right ?
they laughed and they laughed then they all ran away .
and horton was lonely he wanted to play .
he did wanna play .
well i think they're going to go play but horton's got to take care of his little egg right .
great !
he's got responsibilities !
i meant what i said and i said what i meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent .
no matter what happens this egg must be tended .
but poor horton's troubles were far far from ended .
for while horton sat there so faithful so kind .
three hunters came sneaking up softly behind .
he heard the men's steps and turned with a start ?
three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart .
did he run .
he did not .
he stayed on that nest .
he held his head high and threw out his chest .
he looked at the hunters as much as to say .
shoot if you must but i won't .
right .
i meant what i said and i said what i meant an elephant's faithful .
right ?
hm .
mhm .
that's right .
sat all that day .
but the men didn't shoot much to horton's surprise they dropped their three guns and they stared with wide eyes .
look they all shouted can such a thing be .
an elephant sitting on top of a tree .
it's strange it's amazing it's wonderful new .
don't shoot him we'll catch him that's just what we'll do .
let's take him alive why he's terrible funny .
we'll sell him back home to a circus .
right .
no that wasn't very nice .
and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon with ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on ?
no they're not so nice !
no those hunters are not so nice .
well this little animal's nice .
right and horton's nice .
yeah .
but horton so sad he practically .
right .
no .
we're off the men shouted and off they all went with horton unhappy .
one hundred percent .
oh no .
up out of the jungle up into the sky up over the mountains ten thousand feet high .
and down down the mountains and down to the sea went the cart with the elephant egg nest and .
right .
then out of the wagon and onto a ship out over the ocean and oh .
what a trip .
no he doesn't feel so well .
rolling and tossing and splash with a spray .
no .
and horton said day after day after day i meant what i said and i said what i meant but oh am i .
oh poor horton .
after bobbing around for two weeks like a cork they landed at last in the town of .
new york who lives in new york .
that's one of the hunters .
um one of them's right here .
he's probably still on the boat .
i think .
who lives in new york honey ?
exactly !
all ashore the men shouted and down with a lurch .
when elephant ?
horton the elephant still on his perch .
tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him .
bop .
horton landed and then .
then sold him ?
sold to a circus then week after week they showed him to people at ten cents a peek .
they took him to .
boston .
yeah how does he get from boston .
whoa careful oh my gosh careful sweetie ?
watch out for your granola bites .
got a little smushed .
they took him to boston to kalamazoo chicago weehawken and washington too !
to dayton ohio ?
careful sweets oh my gosh ?
to dayton ohio saint paul minnesota wichita kansas and drake .
north dakota !
and everywhere thousands of folks flocked to see and laugh at the elephant up in a tree .
poor horton grew sadder the farther he went .
but he said as he sat in that hot noisy tent .
i meant what i said and i said what i meant an elephant's faithful one hundred percent .
then one day .
the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not so far from .
right .
is that nice .
sure .
and dawdling a long way up high in the sky who of all people should chance to fly by but that old good for nothing bird runaway maisy .
still on vacation and still just as .
right .
no maisy is not very nice .
and spying the flags on the tents just below she !
i hope she's gonna be nice again .
she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door good gracious gasped maisy i've seen you before ?
poor horton looked up with his face white as chalk .
he started to speak but before he could talk .
there rang out the noisiest ear splitting squeaks from the egg that he'd sat on for fifty one weeks .
but it's mine screamed the bird when she heard the egg crack .
the work was all done now she wanted it back .
it's my egg she sputtered you stole it from me get off of my nest and get out of my tree .
not a nice bird .
now .
poor horton backed down with a sad heavy heart .
but at that very instant the egg burst apart .
and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg that he'd sat on so long and so well !
horton the elephant saw something whiz .
it had ears and a tail and a trunk .
just like .
and the people came shouting what's all this about and they looked and they stared with their eyes popping out .
and they cheered and they cheered and they cheered more and more .
they'd never seen anything like it before .
my goodness my gracious they shouted my word .
it's something quite new it's an .
an elephant bird .
no she's not so nice that maisy .
and it should be it should be it should be like that because horton was faithful he sat and he sat he meant what he said and he said what he meant and they sent him home .
happy .

baby kangaroo ?
a kangaroo is called a joey when it is a baby .
joey is still only a few months old like all kangaroos he has strong back legs large feet and a long tail .
when joey moves it's easy to see why his legs and body are so big and strong ?
he hops .
joey bounces along on his back legs using his tail for balance .
joey finds two other young kangaroos who are awake too .
they start to wrestle each other poking tummies and tugging on ears and tails .
little joey leads the others in a hopping race .
a clucking noise makes him stop suddenly ?
it is his mother calling him .
she uses this sound to tell joey that he has wandered too far from her .
joey turns returns to his mother he is very tired now .
he climbs head first into a small pouch on in his mother's tummy ?
the baby is the perfect the pouch is the perfect size for her baby ?
only joey's legs are sticking out .
then he turns himself around in the pouch so he can see .
a kangaroo's mother's pouch makes a great built in bed for her babies .
an adult kangaroo stamps its foot on the ground that sound means danger ?
joey's mother lifts her head and sniffs the air ?
suddenly a dingo dog comes running from the trees .
the kangaroos must escape ?
they jump away flying through the air ?
joey ducks down into his mother's pouch his mother has never moved so fast .
the pack of dingo dogs can't keep up .
soon the dingos drop back .
the kangaroos are safe but they keep on moving ?
they are heading toward a patch of rain clouds ?
the kangaroos know that tasty green grass grows wherever rain has fallen ?
the group reaches its new home before dark ?
kangaroos settle into their new home .
night is coming and it is getting cooler .
joey and the other kangaroos will spend the evening feeding .
joey's mother nibbles grass she uses her short front arms and big back feet to hop step forward .
joey's little tummy is full now joey leaves his mother's pouch .
it is grooming time .
he uses a paw to comb the fur on his legs .
his arms tummy chest back and floppy ears .
he licks his arm and rubs him all over his face .
grooming keeps joey clean and keeps the biting bugs away .
when joey is finished grooming he looks for a playmate ?
joey hops to a pool filled with fresh rain water .
the pool is new to him .
the land where he lives is normally very dry ?
joey looks into the water he sees another kangaroo looking back at him .
who is it ?
do you know ?
he saw him in the water .
he was looking in water ?
but he thought it was another kangaroo ?
joey leans closer to look in the water at the stranger's face .
oops joey dips his nose in the water and gets all wet .
the water feels wonderful joey hops right into the puddle ?
soon other young kangaroos join him there .
they discover what older kangaroos already know .
water is fun .
wanna see all the footprints .
see these ones here .
see if you can find those in these .
in this circle of different ones .
yep .

here's the snow owl ?
at home on the tundra ?
and that tiny tiger's at home in the jungle .
right .
which one this the one about the owl .
okay .
the long winter snow is just beginning to melt away as mother snowy owl scrapes a shell or nest on top of a very small hill .
the ground is still wet so mother owl lines the nest with moss and feathers .
she settles into the nest and she calls to father snowy owl ?
mother owl lays a glossy white roundish egg in the nest and sits on top of it .
sharing the warmth of her body with the egg ?
father owl brings a lemming for her to eat so she doesn't have to leave the nest ?
the next day mother owl lays another white egg and two days after that another .
until there are eight eggs in the nest ?
the spring's wildflowers bloom bright as mother owl sits patiently on the nest .
she and father owl call to each other to keep in touch ?
as the long spring days pass father owl makes many flights to hunt for lemmings and hares .
he flies swiftly and silently .
father owl brings back meals caught in his sharp claws .
finally the first tiny owlet hatches out of the first egg laid by mother owl .
baby snow is covered with soft white down .
as soon as snowy is able to eat father and mother owl feed him tender bits they have stored nearby .
the next day another owlet hatches .
after seven days snowy has seven brothers and sisters .
right .
father owl calls out a loud hoo hoo ?
snowy and the rest of the owlets are growing bigger every day .
mother owl no longer covers them in the nest ?
mother owl stands guard near the nest while father owl searches for a hare to .
feed the large family ?
during the mid summer when the arctic nights are as light as day snowy steps out of the nest and spreads his wings .
snowy strides down the small hill he is the first owlet in the family to climb over the rocks ?
and walk through all of the wildflowers through the nest .
he sees a snow goose gliding above him .
snowy is so happy he hoots .
mother owl and the owlets look over from the nest .
to make sure snowy is safe .
snowy spends many hours exploring the tundra around the nest ?
day by day his brothers and sisters become explorers too .
as they grow old enough to leave the nest .
look at him ?
is he cute .
now can you remember any of these ?

it was morning in the jungle ?
monkeys and birds chatter in the tree tops .
it's a morning just like any other or is it .
look three tiger cubs come tumbling out of their dark cave today is their first day outdoors they are eight weeks old and ready to explore ?
the bright sun makes the cubs blink .
their eyes are used to the darkness of the cave .
a monkey screams and two cubs scramble for cover ?
the third cub is smaller but much braver than her brothers .
she looks for the monkey .
her name is tiny tiger .
one day she will grow up to be a beautiful tigress .
a low grunting sound brings all three cubs running .
the cubs know the familiar sound of their mother's voice .
tiny tiger and her brothers follow mother tiger through the tall jungle grass .
their stripes hide them very well ?
to other animals they looks like swaying grasses filled with shadows and sunlight ?
tiny tiger is amazed by the world around her there is so much to see smell and hear .
tiny tiger sees her mother's long tail swing ?
she tries to catch it ?
mother holds her tail high out of her baby's reach .
tiny tiger turns to chase her own tail round in circles she goes .
her mother grunts softly ?
keep moving ?
the tiger family comes upon a small lake .
it is quiet cool and shady .
perfect for the hot tigers .
first mother tiger checks the area for danger .
no jackals or jaguars just a few harmless little birds .
the three young tigers have never been swimming .
like all tigers the three cubs love water ?
they march right in ?
the little cubs rustle and tumble by the cool jungle lake .
tiny tiger sees a peacock .
she takes a few steps toward the beautiful bird .
it flies away ?
tiny tiger thinks the peacock is afraid of her .
she is wrong .
the bird has seen something in the large grass .
suddenly a loud roar freezes tiny tiger in her tracks .
there's another tiger here .
the cubs run and hide behind her mother .
mother tiger is not scared because she knows this visitor ?
he is father tiger .
they rub necks to say hello .
tiny tiger bravely jumps from behind her mother .
she grows a baby growl .
her father gently rubs her with his big paw before going on his way .
tiny tiger is a playful cub .
she creeps slowly and quietly to practice hunting ?
her little body stays low to the ground and her ears press flat against her head .
suddenly she jumps .
she has caught a peacock feather .
one day tiny tiger will catch real food ?
today it's just for fun though .
her brother chases her trying to steal her prize .
the family returns home for a short nap .
the cubs cuddle together under their cave .
mother tiger washes each of the three cubs with her rough tongue ?
then she lies down with him to rest ?
after her nap mother tiger hunts for food for her little cubs .
she leaves them safely napping near the cave .
tiny tiger's legs kick as she sleeps .
she dreams of the day when she will grow up to roam the jungle as a mighty tigress ?
she will grow up to be her ?
like her mama won't she .

or this one .
okay ?
okay .
that's for william .
no .
they what .
okay alright ?
that's fine we'll just leave it here .
thought i would try .
see look at .
here's the dance giraffing making all these beautiful moves .
gerald was a tall giraffe whose neck was long and slim .
but his knees were awfully crooked and his legs were rather thin .
he was very good and standing still and munching shoots off trees .
but when he tried to run around he buckled at the knees .
now every year in africa they hold the jungle dance .
where every single animal turns up to skip and prance ?
and this year .
oh and this year when the day arrived poor gerald felt so sad .
because it .
when it came time to dance he was really very bad ?
the wart hog started waltzing and the rhinos rock and rolled .
the lions danced the tango that was elegant and bold .
they're doing chacha that's right ?
gerald swallowed .
okay alright alright .
alright .
yeah .
yeah those are the chimps doing chacha see and here they are watching ?
gerald swallowed bravely as he walked toward the floor but !
no they're not doing dancing no they're watching .
but the lion saw him coming and they soon began to roar .
hey look at clumsy gerald the animals all sneered ?
giraffes can't dance you silly fool oh gerald you're so weird !
they're right he thought i'm useless oh i feel like such a clod ?
so he crept off from the dance floor and he started walking home .
he'd never felt so sad before so sad and all alone .
then he found a little clearing and he looked up at the sky ?
the moon can be so beautiful he whispered with a sigh .
excuse me coughed a cricket who'd seen gerald earlier on ?
but sometimes when you're different you just need a different song ?
listen to the swaying grass and listen to the trees ?
to me the sweetest music is those branches in the breeze .
so imagine that the lovely moon is playing just for you .
that's gerald the giraffe ?
everything makes music if you really want it to .
yeah wow .
that if he listens to the music of his own song that he can .
with that the cricket smiled and picked up .
yeah what listen .
the violin that's right .
with that the cricket smiled and picked up his violin ?
then gerald felt his body do the most amazing thing .
that's right ?
his neck was gently swaying and his tail was swishing around ?
he threw his arms out sideways and he swung them everywhere .
then he did a backwards somersault and leapt up in the air .
gerald felt so wonderful his mouth was open wide ?
i'm dancing yes i'm dancing i'm dancing gerald cried .
then one by one each animal who'd been there at the dance .
arrived while gerald boogied on ?
and watched him quite entranced .
they shouted it's a miracle we must be in a dream ?
yeah gerald's the best dancer that we've ever ever seen .
how did you learn how to dance like that please gerald tell us how ?
but gerald simply twirled around and finished with a bow ?
and he raised his head and looked up at the moon and stars above .
we all can dance he said when we find music that we love .
who else wants wheat germ ?
that's too much wheat germ .
that's right it's a rhyme .
right it lost its wheel .
okay in a minute .
uh what shall we call it .
the little bag that clips on .
should we go get that ?
to clip it on you so you can wear it .
you just wanna eat grapes ?
okay .
i'm gonna give you the grapes over here ?
find what .
aha .
you already found them ?
you can have them out of this bowl if you want .
it's a colander you're right .
it's a strainer .
i'm gonna put this here okay .
are they good grapes .
that's good ?
without having it bother you .
if you're walking around it would be a good idea to uh .
to wear it and put the transmitter in it .
you could carry olivia and the transmitter in it .
is she too little to have a transmitter .
mhm .
well um you know amanda and katherine sent us that for the transmitter but i think they wouldn't mind if olivia also rides in it ?
olivia might actually enjoy riding on top of the transmitter .
what do you think ?
she might .
she could stand on top of it in the little pouch ?
that might be fun .
but we'll we'll get that in a little bit .
we're going to cook some things now .
after .
you can have your snack .
that's fine .
you could put rags away for me in a minute too .
that's fine you can just eat .
it's fine .
um what am i doing .
i'm making saag which means i have to wash a big bowl full of .
mustard greens ?
that kind of a vegetable is called mustard greens .
one in .
hanging in the bag there .
that's what that is .
well i need to put it in a lot of water to wash it really nicely .
to make sure that the mustard greens get very clean cause we're going to cook them and eat them .
cause they don't taste very good if you don't cook them .
i think they're kind of bitter .
i think they taste bitter .
bitter is a flavor .
let me think if you've tasted anything bitter .
i think you have tasted something bitter but i'm trying to think of what it was .
you know what you had that was a little bit bitter .
do you remember once i think you ate some brie cheese ?
when we went to prodigal son in hyannis ?
and mommy got some brie cheese and some fruit on a plate to eat ?
i think that you tried it and i think you actually liked it ?
but that flavor was a bitter flavor ?
well i don't really want this shirt to get messy cause this is a shirt that i like .
and i'm gonna do some cooking .
adjust this a bit .
today is november .
thursday november fourteenth .
so we're just about a week out from last time we taped .
i'm gonna get the bowl .
do you remember that ?
it was quite a while ago .
he likes to go there to get coffee sometimes ?
he likes their coffee the way they make coffee there .
i think he thinks it has a good flavor .
i think he thinks the coffee that they make at prodigal son has a good flavor .
well you'd have to ask daddy .
he's the one who knows why .
the flavor of that is bitter ?
actually it's also spicy so you might not like it .
why don't you take it out .
those are spicy greens .
ooh we're gonna have spicy food tonight .
do you like spicy food ?
do you think daddy likes it ?
do you think mommy likes it ?
the sleepy likes it too ?
i think sleepy likes it ?
a little what of paprika ?
a drag .

a drag a drag !
cause we're gonna make saag which is a very nice spicy dish and we're gonna have spicy fish too .
spicy nag ?
oh that sounds very interesting .
spicy nag ?
what ingredients does it have ?
egg and milk and all that kind of stuff .
mm ?
does he know how to make it himself ?
aha ?
does he stir things ?
oh which stool .

and he doesn't know any better .

hello michaela .
is that what henry the hippo says to lars the polar bear .
who are you and why are you so white ?
i often wonder that myself ?
yes ?
mm it's a good question .
it's a good question .
oh my gosh i do have an apron on .
do i look a little bit like a polar bear .
wearing an apron like this !
i guess i must ?
mm ?
i have an idea about what's scary .
i think there is something scary in here .
i think it's a little girl who's scary .
it's not a little girl .
what could it be then ?
oh my gosh a bear ?
yikes ?
yikes ?
the bear is demanding salmon !
oh brother .
bah ?
i will give you some salmon .
do you want some ?
i happen to have some right here for bear emergencies .
i also have bear food for bear emergencies ?
it might be a little bit spicy why don't you try it .
you've had it before .
it's the same kind you had the other day .
i think you liked it .
it's salty but i think you liked it .
cause you ate it .
that's how i could tell .
you actually ate it .
um it actually has salt in it .
that kind of salmon .
smoked salmon .
that's just what it's called .
cause it's been smoked .
that means it's been cooked in a certain way .
using some salt .
and some smoke i think .
okay big noise coming .
watch out cause i'm gonna use this .
close your ears if you need to .
it's not .
it's the cuisinart noise .
mm okay ?
i'm done doing that .
oops .
sag .
are you still eating the salmon and the cookies .
i see ?
okay ?
i'll give you something else fun to do .
oh .
do you want to get down play in the living room or do you want me to give you something fun to do here ?
okay .
uh just a minute ?
i have to get it .
he did what .
he fixed the toast tongs .
yeah we'll look for the wood glue later ?
okay ?
he did .
i see okay .
oh .
right to the end no .
okay .
these are walnuts with the shells still on them ?
i'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into .
or you could actually put them into the ice cube tray .
in fact you could do .
are they too big for that container .
okay .
mm okay i think you're right ?
so why don't we use this other ice cube tray .
we'll take these out .
and you can actually .
i think we have a muffin tin that has twelve .
yeah .
i'm gonna give you this big muffin tin .
because this has got twelve .
and the ice cube tray also has twelve .
does it .
that's alright though .
why don't you put them .
you can just put them wherever you want okay .
this isn't like the sponges where you make them all go in the same .
these are different kinds of nuts ?
you can practice putting them in there .
whoops ?
whoops whoops whoops okay ?
taking the nuts out .
there you can take them out with your fingers .
that's another walnut ?
that's an almond .
actually you know i'm not sure .
i think it's a brazil nut .
but i'm not positive about that .
i think it's a brazil nut .
let me see .
i think that's a hazel nut .
there are lots of different kinds of nuts .
that's a hazel nut .
just a second .
just a second .
let's see .
show it to me .
i think that's a hazel nut .
i think that's another hazel nut ?
just a second honey .
the ice cube tray has more than twelve and the muffin tin has twelve places for twelve muffins .
just a second honey .
let me see .
oh .
well i'm not sure .
i don't remember .
that's something we're gonna have to look up .
usually when i buy nuts they already have the shells taken off of them .
what you have there are the nuts with the shells still on ?
they have to be broken to be eaten .
let's see .
that one i'm not sure .
you're right it is .
those are the same .
they match don't they .
you have matching .
do you wanna match match the different nuts and the different kinds ?
no i mean you put all the ones that like like this in here put all the ones that look like that ?
oh you've kind of already sorted them for yourself .
i see .
you don't have to do that .
i was just suggesting that you sort practice sorting .
they're too hard for your teeth to chew them .
they're just too hard .
it would break your teeth if you tried to .
crack them .
but a bird or let's see some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it .
people don't have teeth as strong as some animals' teeth .
they just don't .
a bird with a really strong beak might be able to crack that .
i don't really know for sure .
cause i don't know everything and i don't know everything about every kind of bird .
i only know some things about some kinds of birds .
oh dear i think i've forgotten what a chickadee eats .
i think chickadees do eat insects .
if i'm not mistaken .
do you wanna take the nuts and play with them down on the floor ?
okay .
do you wanna help me make some cookies ?
do you need to use the potty love ?
okay ?
alright ?
um do you wanna help make cookies .
okay .
let's see to do that you will need definitely to wash hands ?
why don't you put all the nuts .
let's put all the nuts in one container and save them .
i think we'll save them in a good .
how many are there ?
let's see .
let's put all the nuts in a yogurt container ?
why don't you put them all in there and then .
whoops ?
and then i will help you put the top on it .
daddy especially .
yeah i think you're right .
mommy does too ?
cause it makes the food taste good .
whoa ?
that sounds great .
you made a musical instrument !
you want another yogurt container !
you could make two of those musical instruments .
you put some more nuts in here then you could make another musical instrument ?
it's like a shaky a shaky yogurt container .
not a shaky egg but a shaky yogurt container .
whoops ?
here you go .
you wanna put the other nuts in the other one ?
whoa ?
alright shall i help you put the top on more securely .
are you making one or two of these .
okay ?
okay ?
let's put all of them in then .
here's some more nuts .
let me see this .
let me see .
there try that .
you know what it sounds a little different every time you put more or less nuts in it .
that one will sound empty i bet .
let's put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like .
and close it close it up real tight .
there .
that does sound different .
the nuts .
nuts ?
who says nuts ?
does a squirrel say that .
nuts ?
what did i put in here ?
cornmeal .
whoop ?
oh this mixing bowl is very heavy .
mixer i mean .
mm .
where's the butter that i just had in my hand ?
one two three .
where's my butter ?
cause i just had four sticks of butter and now suddenly i only have three .
i've lost my butter ?
what shall i do ?

you found the butter !
well it's not for playing with .
i didn't know you had it !

when we make the cookie dough i'll let you build something with cookie dough ?
how's that ?
alright .
when we make the cookie dough ?
oh my goodness yes you did have the butter ?
i didn't know you had the butter .
butter is food it's not actually a toy but i will .
i will let you play with some cookie dough after we make the dough okay .
but we need to make the dough first .
you want me to help you put the top on that ?
oh .
okay you're gonna need to pick ?
get on the floor and pick those up okay .
no .
you can put these in here first but then you need to go pick the other nuts up .
i'll help you get down .
and you need to put them away or play with them in the living room .
i don't want them on the floor there .
i'm gonna count to ten then you're gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor .
do you need help getting down ?
i don't mind if you shake it but i want you to pick up the nuts that are spilled on the floor too .
you can shake it ?
you can have it to shake after you pick up the other nuts .
you're having ring around the rosy at the dance party .
here put your other nuts in there .
and then i'll give you the top after you collect all your nuts ?
you're collecting nuts just like a squirrel does .
and then i will let you help me make the cookies if you would like to .
yeah this is some food that i'm picking up off the floor not the nuts .
you're doing a good job picking those up naima .
there's one there .
and there's some up on the table too .

oh fruits and nuts .
in late summer and fall trees produce seeds .
some come in nuts others ?
alright you wanna do the cobweb cake .
fall leaves .
okay well honey i start reading and then you don't like that page maybe oh ?
mushroom hunt ?
early fall is the best time to go i didn't know this honey .
early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms ?
we should tell daddy that ?
you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens .
toadstools and mushrooms are fungi ?
these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal uh other plants or animal dung and feed on them ?
some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs ?
here are some to look for !
cepes !
also known as the porcini i believe .
has a dark brown cap with pores underneath instead of gills .
ooh this is a poisonous one we are not allowed to eat that one ?
let's see which ones look like the ones that we see ?
look at that giant puff ball ?
it's a giant puff ball mushroom ?
dryad's saddle has a pale yellow brown cap with darker scales .
and a crimson wax cap is red .
that's right that's a honey fungus mushroom ?
yeah ooh this mushroom is called a stink horn and it has a nasty strong smell p u .
yeah .
yeah you could ?
yeah ?
yeah look at those and these are called chanterelle mushrooms .
mm this is called a parasol ?
because it looks like an umbrella ?
sweetie can you eat some of your .
cinnamon toast .
look this is all about spiders honey ?
aha ?
is that tasty !
aha .
spiders spin webs to catch insects ?
different spiders have different types of webs .
hm ?
they don't look so nice you don't think ?
they do ?
do the spiders look very nice ?
pretty nice .
how small ?
yeah .
that spider's trying to eat that bug .
don't you think ?
how spiders spin sheet webs in the corners of rooms ?
you're right .
you are right .
uh .
planting .
mhm .
many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand ?
you can plant them in a garden or in pots ?
you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months ?
indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside .
hm pretty .
uh chocolate cobweb cake .
make this delicious cake for a fall party or celebration .
it is very easy .
yeah a little spider ?
all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl ?
that looks good doesn't it .
mhm .
yummy .
you know what that is .
chocolate right .
that is a chocolate cake .
yummy ?
yummy .
as the days grow shorter and colder in the fall some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter .
oh a butterfly how pretty that's called a monarch butterfly .
look at that funny bird !
oh that's a swallow ?
that little bird !
and this is a hoopoe apparently ?
well uh some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's plenty of food this is called migration .
that means when it gets cold out honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's called migration .
neat huh .
mhm .
preparing for winter .
in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter .
many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter .
squirrels bury nuts in the fall .
any nuts that a squirrel forgets about may sprout and grow into trees .
oh look at that .
i'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's pretty huh .
yeah ?
these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter ?
the best time to use the maps is at around eleven p m on a clear night away from city lights ?
you know mommy and daddy grew up in the city and we never saw any stars because there were so many lights in the city .
but the stars look pretty here ?
and one day when you were a little tiny baby mommy and daddy got you up in the middle of the night and took you out to uh a play ground to look at the stars at night ?
i think there were some shooting stars or something like that ?
but we bundled you up and you were nice and warm .
yes i can ?
winter weather ?
in most parts of the winter winter is colder than other seasons ?
the days are shorter and the nights are longer .
in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow .
and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months .
hm ?
this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker .
yeah that's very neat .
stormy skies .
water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds .
especially if you wet the paper first .
before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects .
wow .
look at this you can make clouds .
oh how pretty .
ooh and there's a castle .
and stormy stormy air ?
winter buds ?
in the winter trees hardly grow at all but slow down and rest ?
oh ?
i think it's a tree actually with a little bud ?
see .
is that neat .
all these look at all these different little sticks with things growing on them huh .
let's see if we can find our tree in the back .
our tree's a red oak tree .
i don't see any oaks here .
here's a turkey oak maybe that's sort of ?
sort of like ours .
let's see ?
that's right .
look at all those beautiful green leaves .
that's an oak leaf .
that's kinda like what falls from our tree .
this one .
that's kinda brown and then these are green right .
winter trees .
trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees .
well you learn something every day huh .
almost all of them have broad flat leaves .
deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring ?
do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles ?
or manny rakes them up for us because he's better at it than we are ?
winter flowers oh look at all .
few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal ?
look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands .
the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here .
when winter is over ?
camellias those are pretty huh .
they do look like roses they do ?
baked potatos .
yummy .
oh those are tomatoes you're right those are tomatoes and these are potatos !
baked potatos are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day .
below are ?
they're potatos .
do they look like little rocks .
they do .
okay this does not sound good to mommy ?
below are two suggestions for different fillings ?
tuna and sweet corn ?
does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato .
really it doesn't sound so good to mommy .
but you know maybe it's good but ?
it kind of looks like someone threw up ?
but don't let me hold you back !
cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato ?
that sounds good to me does it sound good to you .
cheese and bacon you like bacon don't you .
so this is how you bake ?
make a baked potato sweetie !
you wash your potato .
and you poke it with a fork .
and you put it in a hot oven ?
and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things ?
yummy .
that's right .
that's right .
bird watching .
it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge .
this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand .
know what we should probably do honey .
i think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some .
and then we could see some really neat birds .
maybe we could see a blue jay .
or a cardinal ?
that would be neat .
hm .
oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon ?
birds like bacon too .
everybody likes bacon .
except for maybe a pig .
surviving the winter .
different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter .
some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation .
others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter .
that's a little sleeping hedgehog .
this is a marmot .
it's an alpine marmot .
alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter .
that is they sleep for half the year .
six months .
well that's right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right .
bugs that's right sometimes they shed their skin ?
let's see what it says about summer and spring okay ?
that's very pretty .
yeah but this would be a pretty thing to make one day .
we should make this with phoebe i bet she would like to make these don't you think .
would you like to take your cinderella wig off sweetie .
no .
looks pretty snazzy ?
planting seeds did we plant .
we planted some things in the backyard didn't we .
plant flower seeds indoors early in spring and they will flower in the summer .
here you can see how to grow pansies from seeds but you can plant most other small flower seeds in the same way .
you fill the little containers with soil .
and you put two little seeds in each section .
cover the box with newspaper and leave it outside .
water every few days .
that's interesting .
i did not know that .
after two weeks shoots will appear ?
that is very very interesting .
hm .
how about that ?
i did not even know that .
and put them in a big pot .
is that a bad piece .
you don't like the crust honey ?
of the bread .
no hm .
you know what i don't have any more bread those were our last two slices mommy has to go buy some more bread .
i don't have any more but i can get you something else .
oh look at this from tadpole to frog .
well i don't have any more toast sweetie pie !
we have to go to the supermarket to buy it ?
oh that is a beetle ?
that's a swimming beetle ?
whoops watch out for your ?
right .
that's right ?
that's right .
from tadpole to frog ?
early in the spring frogs lay their eggs which are called frog spawn ?
uh a newt ?
that's a newt ?
newt ?
newt .
it's a newt .
it's a newt .
okay .
frogs lay their eggs in .
and those are newts .
wanna hear about frogs how frogs grow .
frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond .
yeah that's kind of a little weird .
after about ten days tadpoles wiggle out .
that's what they look like it kind of looks .
sort of looks like a frog but sort of looks like a fish !
and they swim in search of food .
the tadpoles then grow legs .
and they come to the surface of the water to breathe .
after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs .
wow that's neat ?
oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are ?
who'd ?
that's right with matt and aunt jill hid all sorts of yummy treats didn't she in the eggs .
yeah she's a good egg hunter ?
that's true you guys found bunnies too .
you're right .
oh look .
that is cute !
bunnies .
bunny ?
bunny bunny bunny ?
aw look at the baby animals .
the baby ducks .
aw and what are these .
little baby pigs called piglets ?
do you know someone named piglet ?
who is he friends with ?
pooh bear that's right .
oh summer .
summer summer summer .
uh ?
what's that ?
butterfly that's right .
spring is a good ?
that's a caterpillar ?
spring is a ?
mhm .
caterpillar caterpillar .
spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country .
many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant .
wow .
he is looking at you .
the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger .
and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself .
or a cocoon .
and when it comes out .
well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they .
ah a big butterfly or a moth .
hm .
well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth .
a moth is a moth .
wow .
oh yummy .
that is tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with fresh basil .
yes and you love cheese too so that's just delicious .
we had mozzarella and tomatoes last week when manny brought us lots of yummy tomatoes right .
you want something to eat now ?
would you like some you want me to get you some champagne crepes .
well how would you go about asking for that water ?
okay .
put you some water in this cup for you okay .
here you go sweets ?
tomato feast .
sorry honey i just coughed on you .
let me hold this until you get up on the couch .
can you scooch over a little ?
thank you very much .
what do you say ?
you're welcome ?
mm homegrown vegetables taste delicious and you don't even need a garden .
here you can find out how to grow tomatoes in pots .
hm interesting .
maybe we should do that next year ?
yes tomatoes are red so delicious ?
yeah delicious .
that's yummy .
hm summer flowers oh that's very pretty .
uh bug watch .
what are those ?
beetles have hardened front wings that protect their delicate flying wings .
look for them under bark .
um that's another type that's called a devil's coach horse beetle .
and this is a green shield beetle .
and this is a click beetle .
that apparently is a cockchafer beetle .
yeah and what's this ?
that's a dragonfly right .
right .
wow you're right .
um beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere ?
ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil .
if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole .
the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony ?
they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went .
bees there's a little bumble bee ?
bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers .
most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time .
as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen .
the sticky yellow dust inside flowers ?
it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds ?
that's great .
okay you hold the bug page open honey ?
okay ?
when i come back are you gonna tell me something great about bugs ?
you know what we may sweetie what we may do later .
we may have to stop at the mall okay .
did you learn anything exciting about bugs while i was gone .
what did you learn ?
did you find did you learn that let's see .
dragonflies fly .
those are ants ?
dragonflies fly low above ponds and streams early in the summer .
their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects .
you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun .
butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers .
like bees they feed on nectar ?
watch how they stretch .
yeah there's a butterfly .
hm ?
interesting .
okay uh snail trail .
snails live in damp shady places and are easy to find .
that's a snail ?
a damp shady place that's where they like .
damp is like kind of wet .
mhm !
let mommy get a paper towel sweets .
here we go .
better .
snails slither along the ground ?
snail trail .
snails slither along the ground leaving a trail of slime behind them .
ew .
slime .
see here's the slime a trail of slime !
the slime .
yeah the slime helps them cling to things .
uh no those are little eggs ?
those are little baby snails .
those are baby baby uh snails ?
a snail has two pairs of tentacles ?
it smells with one pair and has eyes on the other .
ew that is so neat huh .
kind of yucky but neat too right ?
my goodness .
that is very ?
oh the slime the slime ?
well .
yeah .
well you could touch some that's true i guess .
snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain .
this is because their skin is not waterproof !
and they die if they dry out .
oh look that's interesting .
that's a snail he's on top of a banana .
that's the snail .
and that's his shell ?
in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime .
most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots .
if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures .
it's best to explore at low tide when the sea is out .
try looking along the line of seaweed that marks the high water level ?
at the top of the beach .
um i don't see any seaweed in this picture but .
that is seaweed .
seaweed .
we saw seaweed when we went to the beach with tamara didn't we .
mhm what's this what's this ?
the starfish ?
a starfishy hm ?
look at all these different types of shells ?
that is really neat .
cone shells prickly cockle shells spider conch .
cat's paw scallop !
oysters .
wow .
mussels welch's .
that's pretty neat .
hm .
beach treasures .
there are lots of things you can do with the treasures you have collected from the beach .
you could make .
well .
someone collected rocks and then painted pretty pictures on them .
well now they're painted very pretty painted rocks .
like you know that rock that they .
that house down there has a rock with numbers painted on it .
it's like that only they painted flowers and things on these rocks ?
very pretty .
mushroom time .
harvest time .
many different foods and drinks are made from plants .
fruit and vegetables come from plants but so do other everyday foods such as flour coffee cocoa oil and sugar .
chocolate .
you make chocolate out of cocoa beans .
most plant foods are grown as crops and are picked or harvested in the summer .
look for combine harvesters working in the fields late in the summer .
these huge machines harvest crops such as wheat oats rye and barley ?
that are grown for their seeds or grain .
combine harvesters don't just cut they crop they also gather it together and separate the grain from the stalk ?
the grain is ground into flour or used to make bread or breakfast cereal .
neat .
what are these ?
oh you know what they look just like the black eyed susans it's hard to tell in this picture but those are sunflowers .
right .
because they're so big .
right ?
it's .
can you what ?
can you tell them yeah tell me what they are ?
they are sunflowers .
in some countries with warm climates sunflowers are grown as a crop .
that is string you're right ?
you did ?
the sunflower seeds are harvested and used to make cooking oil ?
let's not chew on your barrette angel .
corn .
corn is a tall leafy plant grown for its plump yellow cobs of grain .
most corn is grown for animal feed but it also .
corn .
feed corn .
animals eat corn a lot .
chickens and cows well cows i don't know chickens .
it's also used to make cooking oil breakfast cereals and popcorn .
some sweet varieties are sold as corn on the cob .
hm and look at all the soft fruits .
did we go picking .
did we pick fruits .
yeah we picked blueberries and raspberries right .
oh look .
wow .
if the sun comes out between clouds when it's raining it shines through the drops of water and you may suddenly see a rainbow .
rainbows are always on the opposite side of the sky from the sun so you have to stand with your back to the sun to see them .
colors in a rainbow are always in the same order .
red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet .
wow .
in spring the weather can change very quickly .
strong winds and sudden showers are often followed by rainbows or sunshine .
you can find out how strong the wind is by looking out for the signs around you .
watching .
the wind is the wind blowing very fast .
yeah very fast ?
look at all this different types of clouds .
the wind is too fast .
yeah these you know these fluffy clouds are called cumulonimbus clouds .

okay you took it out .
yeah .
little miss spider popped out of her egg swinging down by a thread she hung on by one ?
leg ?
watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover she dangled there wondering where is my ?
mother .
did she squeeze down a hole or dive underwater why won't she come out here and meet her new .
right ?
she climbed to the tippity top of a tree gazing out on the world she thought where could mom .
where could she be ?
a beetle named betty buzzed by this high perch a child needs a mother may i please help you .
right .
she is .
i don't know for sure but i'll offer this clue if i were your mom i'd be looking for .
mhm .
they flew through the trees spying down from the sky and asked all the butterflies fluttering by .
but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone .
she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig .
have you seen my mom she's like me .
right .
yeah that spider not so nice .
the sly spider laughed as he gobbled his snack a bear is a mother who's yellow and black .
with her heart full of joy she peered over her straw but it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw .
it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried your dinner's here darlings so open up wide .
before she could blink she was whisked out of sight and brave beetle betty was hugging her ?
right ?
in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree the kind beetle asked won't you stay here .
with me .

uh i think i have to open the door .
just a minute naima ?
the um barn into the veterinary hospital .

what do you think ?
let's take them out so that there's room for the .
yes i know .

that's what he's doing right now .
why don't you take the animals out and we'll have a veterinary hospital in the barn ?
and ?
okay ?
oh oh ?
you mean like a i v fluid is what you mean .
oh great idea .
yep animals might need special water .
oh is that um bees wax .
i'm making more room on the floor and taking down the trains .
yeah .
it might be hard to get that out actually .
do you want that to come out ?
do you want me to help you ?
i think we need something to take it out like a chopstick or something very narrow that could poke it out .
i might need a special tool to take out that wax .
no something very narrow .
like a pen even or ?
something very small ?
oh you took it out .
oh no there's still a little bit in there ?
good it's not soft right now .
there .
now it's all out .
should i take that .
okay ?
great ?
uh so ?
the tree's gonna be the treadmill at the veterinary hospital ?
mm is that for checking how well the animals' hearts are working .
oh .
okay ?
pushpa is the doctor or the nurse ?
pushpa is the veterinarian okay .
okay .
that's a good question .
i think so ?
that tree is a painted tree ?
that i think is a willow tree isn't it ?
it's a certain kind of a tree that grows near the water ?
and what ?
yeah .
it could be growing near the pond at the farm .
mm to hold the base of the tree .
well there's two pieces of wood making up that tree .
there's this part and there's this part and this is attached to this with the screws .
i think it's supposed to be the grass under the tree .
i think that's what that's supposed to be .
yeah .
okay .
okay here's the doctor .
oh he's the veterinarian .
okay .
let's see .
who's going to bring the sick animal ?
who's the sick animal now ?
which .
all of them .
okay .
well in the morning the doctors probably have to do their rounds .
that means they visit all the sick patients .
oh so what happens at nighttime at the veterinary hospital ?
curl up .
her mother is a doctor .
i'll be right back ?
i'm gonna look something up naima ?
so only about five minutes has elapsed since i stopped recording ?
when i played it back i heard a little interference that then went away so i'm hoping it's not major interference ?
okay .
let's see what's happening with these animals .
yeah .
oh ?
okay that's the receipt .
okay .
yeah .
okay we can play that when we get home from gym class sure .
okay .
do you want to keep playing uh veterinary hospital now ?
alright .
alright oh is this a sick mouse .
okay .
where's the veterinarian ?
i think this this person is gonna bring the mouse into the veterinary hospital .
this is my pet mouse and it has a hurt tail .
can you examine my mouse and figure out what the problem is with the tail ?
and maybe bandage the tail .
okay ?
you mean which door is for which stall .
oh it's hard when they're open to figure it out isn't it ?
these are the stalls that are veterinary hospital ?
okay .
okay does the mouse need some medicine ?
and who else is an animal who's gonna be brought to the veterinary hospital ?
this little cow hit its ear on a speaker at the concert ?
oh .
well maybe this little calf needs its ear examined ?
and the mother is coming along with it to keep it company .
and here's the doctor .
what does the doctor say ?
mm ?
okay ?
well should i come back to check on my cows in the morning .
okay .
goodbye ?
goodbye .
there's a stall for you i think where you can be while you're getting better here at the veterinary hospital ?
a colt .
it hit its nose on pushpa .
oh ?
does it need a nose bandage .
oh dear ?
that's quite .
is that something like a concert injury ?
i see .
oh and my horse and my colt are here at the veterinary hospital too .
and i know they will take good care of them so i will go back to the farm and do farm work while they are here being treated by the veterinarians .
treated well by the veterinarians ?
okay i've got to go back and feed my other animals here ?
the veterinary hospital could have a barn cat who lives here who isn't sick who just lives here all the time ?
the pig's eating something .
mm ?
what's wrong with the cat ?
it licked too much milk ?
oh .
huh .
did it get a tummy ache from that .
i see .
oh .
okay .
pushpa what are you going to do ?
you gonna examine the cat ?
pushpa is the veterinarian isn't she ?
yeah ?
you can't do it .
what does she do ?
what's she gonna do to examine it ?
oh .
shall we get some medicine made out of bees wax up here ?
here's some cat medicine .
when cats get upset tummies they can have that kind of medicine ?
cause that's the .
that's how it normally is .
it's only soft if it gets warmed up by something like someone's body or .
once i warmed it up in the oven and it all melted together and all the colors ran together .
are you gonna warm it up right there ?
it's gonna take it a while take it a long time to warm up ?
in the night ?
you mean when it falls out of my clothes .
i think we're gonna need to get dressed to go to the gym class soon .
cause otherwise we're gonna miss it .
very soon though ?
let's play this for five more minutes and then we'll get on some ?
you could even wear your leotard if you want to ?

um maybe we could get some white bees wax .
do we have a tiny little bowl somewhere naima ?
a tiny tiny bowl ?
yeah it's not really warm enough right now ?
ah this will make some good milk .
this is warm now if you wanna make some medicine out of that .
i'll make some milk out of this one .
i don't have any good place to put that .
here i'm gonna warm this white part up and make some milk out of it !
can you find a little dish for the cat to eat from ?
mm well we need to use that .
i guess you can use that for a little while ?
yes ?
here's the milk ?
no this is white milk .
there you go ?
mm now the cat can have some milk .
oops .
the cat fell upside down in the big milk bowl .
that's gonna be a wet cat .
that cat's gonna need to be toweled off .
toweled dry .

let's check this .
okay that seemed to be recording very nicely .
let's see what's gonna happen next .

let me feel your belly ?
oh yes i feel the lantern in there .
but those are very tiny lanterns aren't they .
are you their mother .
how big was the lantern ?
oh .
i think they'll probably poop it out .
who was there when they swallowed the lanterns their mothers or their father ?
a babysitter was there .
oh .
and then did the babysitter tell the bears' father what had happened .
oh .
oh ?
oh and they couldn't take them out quickly huh .
they just swallowed them by accident ?
sounds like they did it on purpose .
are they little toddlers .
oh bear .
let me give you a little medicine to make your tummy feel better .
and let your mother hold you to help you feel better .
really ?
oh ?
and that's why it's crying .
hm .
oh ?
i see .
oh ?
that poor poor bear ?
i think the medicine will start working very soon and he will feel better very soon .
oh that one needs medicine ?
okay let's get it some medicine ?
its mother is taking it away from the medicine ?
yeah but the mother has it and the mother can help it have the medicine ?
oh ?
well the doctor will come back in the room when the bear is ready to have medicine ?
the doctor has so many patients to see .
the doctor can't wait ?
oh good .
i see ?
mhm ?
alright let's go back in and we'll give the bear some medicine .
okay okay hold the bear on your lap ?
the mother has to help the bear have the medicine .
okay .
okay little bear just calm down cause everything is gonna be alright .
this medicine actually tastes like blueberries did you know that ?
it has blueberry flavor .
here it is right here .
see .
it's not too bad ?
and then your mommy can give you hugs and kisses to also help you feel better .
okay i'm gonna give you a prescription to take home to get medicine for you bear .
give that medicine to the bear twice a day .
and he'll be better very soon ?
hey these don't belong with my underwear .

yep because we're going to go to a new gym class .
no it's not cape cod gymnastics .
no sleepy it's a different gym ?
i sure am ?
i sure am .
what song doesn't he like ?
how does he know what song is gonna be there at the gym class ?
are you talking about cape cod gymnastics ?
they do play loud music there .
that's one of the things i don't like about that gym class ?
but this one i don't know if there's music or not .
we'll just have to go and find out .
but we do have to get ready ?
oh don't play with that it's not a toy .
okay what i'd like you to do is take off your big kid pants and ?
oh sorry about all this ?
and your pajamas .
oh really .
for me .
i don't wrap very well .
oh they won't all fit in that small piece of paper .
today is saturday february twenty eighth .
hm .
hm the calf and the cow .
calf i said calf ?
mhm .
mhm .
okay ?
alright .
well dogs eat dog food but we can find out more about dog food ?
okay alright ?
we'll find out about ?
oh ?
is he gonna put the milk in a little pail ?
i wonder if i could make a pail out of ?
oh you're right baby cows don't have udders ?
calves don't have udders ?
maybe i could make a milking pail out of bees wax ?
oh there's a price tag on this ?
hm ?
no ?
let's see .
um some farm animals like to eat things like corn cobs from corn on the cob leftover cobs ?
uh i don't know if cows like that in particular but i think some other animals do ?
hello ?
hi guys ?
oh i hope you're having fun .
it's nice and bright in here ?
isn't it ?
i'm coming to say bye .
i was downstairs .
and now i'm going to the office for a little while .
thank you ?
have fun baby o ?
bye ?
what are you thinking a couple hours or an hour or what ?
well you know i have ?
it's almost four ?
about five six seven hours of work so i'm gonna do ?
okay .
probably an hour and a half be home by five thirty six ?
okay ?
splishedy splashedy ?
here's a corn cob ?
one of the animals can eat the corn cob ?
you know we could look up which animals eat corn cobs ?
i know that pigs like them .
i'm not sure if horses are allowed to eat corn cobs or not .
we could look that up ?
why you're right it's not very soft cause i didn't put this one in my bra .
i'm trying to make these without doing that ?
i was gonna make a milking pail with the black bees wax .
is it .
no ?
that one wasn't ?
here you can roll it just the way you roll playdoh .
did you know that .
mhm .
i've actually started putting things in here in my in the waist of my pants ?
i think that's pretty hard .
is it .
maybe cause it's been in your hand for a little while .
whose job is it to feed the animals at your farm ?
is it veena's job or pushpa's job to feed ?
it's his job .
oh the baby doesn't belong there ?
why don't you put the baby in the cradle ?
put it there or in your bed maybe ?
an unmouthed baby ?
cause it doesn't have a mouth ?
sometimes it takes a while for these things to warm up .
i was just handling that one .
i just made that corn cob ?
i was gonna make the pail now ?
you were handling that ?
and it got warm .
no i wasn't but that's a very thin piece so it probably wouldn't take much to warm it .
put it against your belly and see if it warms up quickly .
hold it with your palm and see if it gets softer ?
yeah i think so .
yeah i was handling that .
can you tell because it's softer ?
mhm .
mhm .
hm ?
mhm .
i'm making the milking pail so that the farmer can milk the cow ?
okay ?
oh from the cow nice fresh milk ?
here's the milking pail .
that's the pail ?
it's a pail to .
well not if you're gonna squeeze it .
otherwise you could have used it to put the milk in .
yes i just made that pail that you are smashing with your fingers with great glee ?
are you smashing it with glee ?
hm .
i'm gonna go down to the basement and photocopy something ?
if you wanna come with me that would be nice ?
i have a little more milk for the cat ?
hm .
a milk what .
dish ?
oh ?
okay ?
well can i have the black back and then i'll make a dish out of it ?
it's not a pail anymore i might as well make a dish out of it .
yes i was .
that's the milk for the cat .
a lucky cat ?
not all cats are given milk ?
not all cats like milk but those that do are lucky they have it .
here's a milk dish .
oh ?
lubriderm for the cow .
does the cow have a sore back or chapped chapped skin on his back ?
here is a milk dish ?
you can put the milk in here .
yeah let's imagine that ?
the other cat can be looking from the barn looking way down at the other cat drinking the milk ?
what do you imagine that cat might be thinking ?
yeah ?
another dish ?
okay .
i'll make a purple dish for the other cat .
well i guess i'm .
i'm actually molding it is what i'm doing .
except that's really too hard .
i think i'm gonna have to see if i've got anything else to make it out of here .
there might be some ?
okay ?
i'm making another dish for the other cat ?
mm .
mm .
mm .
uh that's okay i'll fix it ?
you could just leave that there for now okay .
yeah i don't want it to drag .
it wouldn't be good for it to drag .
i'm attaching this to you .
let's make a .
let's make a pond at the farm .
sometimes farmers will let the animals go down to the pond to drink water ?
who's thirsty ?
which animals would like to come and drink down at the pond .
the calf .
mm on a hot day .
what about the horses ?
mhm .
mm .
hm .
no i was actually going to make these into corn cobs so that the pigs could have something to eat .
i think the pigs are hungry ?
you know what people say when they want the pigs to come and they can feed them .
sometimes people say .
you know when you call a cat you say here kittie kittie kittie here kittie kittie kittie .
well when you're calling pigs you call them in a special way too ?
you say sooey sooey ?
that tells the pigs to come and get their lunch .
or their breakfast or their snack .
sooey ?
where are those pigs ?
sooey .
pushpa is saying sooey .
he's got food for them .
oh .
sooey ?
sooey .
hm ?
they're having some nice corn cobs .
uh that's a good question .
i actually don't know .
i don't know if there's one way to call roosters .
hm .
i don't know .
i only know about pigs and cats i think ?
good question though .
yes .
yeah is it soft now ?
i don't think it was warmed up .
and that warmed it up .
mhm ?
there's the hens and the rooster ?
we have two roosters don't we ?
mm .
there's no sticker .
right ?
mm ?
yes .
she bought you quite a few of these animals for christmas .
yep the pigs .
remember when you first got the barn all we had was the holstein and the calf holstein calf and the barn cat one of the barn cats .
and that rooster and that was all you had for a while .
i think maybe there's a chick missing .
and then she gave you the um .
what kind of cows did we decide these were ?
guernsey .
the guernsey calf and the guernsey cow and the other cat and the horse and the colt .
and that rooster .
yeah ?
and veena and the well the water well and the tree .
and then after that i got you ?
mommy and daddy got you the mouse and the fox .
why ?
mm .
this is a very nice farm .
yes when i and daddy got you the barn we got you pushpa also ?
well i bought it but it's a present from mommy and daddy even though i was the one who actually got it at the store ?
it's a present from mommy and daddy .
for you .
it wasn't even christmas it wasn't even your birthday it was just cause we thought you'd have fun with it ?
you think so ?
are you sitting in the pond ?
oh .
let's see ?
yeah ?
oh this is really soft now ?
do you want it ?
should i make a puddle .
the pigs are in a big mud puddle .
those pigs like to be in mud ?
what is veena gonna help you do ?
oh .
there's another mud puddle oh boy ?
even the little pig is in the mud .
pigs like mud .
oh you're the puddle .
are you an animal .
oh you're another pig ?
oh ?
ooh .
it probably wouldn't really hurt him actually ?
well bees wax is just wax .
it probably would .
it might give him a tummy ache but there's nothing in it that's really really bad for you ?
hm look at this .
i'm making something like a window .
mhm .
duck food .
are you whistling to that song run children run with daddy .
is that on the american folk music album .
yes .
a little ducky .
for the farm .
mhm ?
this is its head that my fingers are on right now ?
okay it wants to swim in the pond .
mhm .
really ?
yes they could say .
they say cluck cluck .
would you like to go to the play ground ?
cause it's getting late ?
if we don't go now then we probably won't have time to go ?
alright .
we don't have to ?
why would the duck be scared ?
oh the animals are making their noises and that makes the duck scared ?
the duck could just quack quack right back at them .
ducks can be very loud and noisy too you know .
the pig's scared of the duck .
mm .
because they're also birds .
oh the cat too huh .
hm .
this hen's gonna eat the leftover corn cobs that the pigs didn't finish ?
yes .
yeah she's supposed to be in a position to pick grain and eat it .
mhm ?
is the farmer gonna help them find it .
i don't know were you .
oh that was the milk bucket .
here's another puddle for them .
mm ?
i wonder if the ducks eat flowers sometimes ?
i bet they do ?
this pig has got mud and dirt all over it ?
cause it's a pig ?
they like to wallow in the mud and the dirt ?
i think cause it probably makes them cool off a little bit ?
yeah i don't think they like hot .
well most animals don't like to be too hot .
even people don't like to be too hot !
is it a muddy pig .
is the farmer washing off the pig ?
okay ?
you're doing a good job making it say that .
well that's what you just said though .
i wanna eat the corn on the cob .
don't smash it up .
don't smash it up .
what are you making out of the corn on the cob ?
what are you making ?
i would like to eat that corn on the cob .
what are you making instead ?
wanna help that pig find it .
oh are we gonna read books now .
we need to clean up a little bit if we're gonna read that .

the the ?
what other house oh i think you've done this before ?
ah this is a book .
wanna read it ?
haha ?
what is this about ?
the great cat chase well .
once upon a time .
there was ?
uh what is that ?
a lady with a cat ?
she looks like a .
those clothes look too big for that lady .
i think maybe she borrows her mommy's clothes .
what do you think ?
yeah ?
is that a possibility ?
uh oh what's happening here ?
can you tell what happened ?
the cat's running out and hiding ?
that mischievous cat !
and she's picking a flower .
and i think she's all excited and alarmed right here ?
oh where's my cat she says ?
and who's this over here .
he's hiding he's a mischievous cat .
and here we have ?
what is she saying now to that person ?
huh .
what who is that do you think ?
a policeman ?
and what do you think she's saying to the policeman .
where's my cat ?
help help where's my cat .
who's this guy ?
he's a boy ?
but he's wearing ?
what kind of boots ?
cowboy boots on his tricycle .
all of a sudden everybody says ?
hey who's that ?
who did they find ?
the cat ?
do we have a name for this cat ?
no ?
shall we give it one ?
no ?
you don't want to give it a name .
how are you gonna call it if you don't know what his name is ?
you say .
here ?
here wh here kittie kittie .
okay .
uh oh and now look what's happening ?
what's happening here ?
you know what that little boy's got on ?
well look on his shirt ?
who's that ?
batman that's just like you can't it .
and i think this police has fallen flat on his nose trying to catch that cat .
kalunk ?
and then they're going along in the woods ?
and suddenly .
the cat goes into a big pipe to hide ?
and then ?
uh oh .
i see trouble .
cause you see what's happening here .
all these guys the policeman and the lady are going in this end of the tunnel .
and if it comes out the other end then they're going to fall into the water ?
and the cat's sitting up here and the cat's going to laugh .
ah that's right .
he's batman ?
and i think it's going to turn out that he knows better than the rest of them how to do this .
what do you think ?
do you think he's going to be the hero of this story ?
uh oh what happened here hm ?
can you tell me what happened ?
that's right .
he fell into the water .
splush ?
and there goes that old cat !
you see he's trying to help her out of the pipe !
and she falls down and kaplunk they both go into the water !
what a mess ?
and now they're really getting wet ?
and the cat is jumping back in the pipe and going right back where they came from .
and what are these people saying .
i don't know .
what are they saying ?
you don't know what they're saying ?
i think they're saying .
stop you pesky cat .
you're driving us crazy .
we're gonna catch you ?
so then the lady and the policeman are putting their clothes back on .
and they crawl into the pipe ?
and look at the other end .
who turned out to have caught the cat ?
the boy .
that's because little boys often know how to do things better than big people can't that right .
hm .
especially if they're batman .
oh ?
then he put the cat right on the policeman's head and the lady is grabbing the little boy by the ear .
and what do you think she's telling him .
i think she's saying something like um .
that wasn't a very nice thing to do !
but he after all caught the cat .
so why should she complain right .
and then the cat is about to go up the tree .
look he scratched the policeman's face off .
and then the policeman's trying to catch the cat .
and here he got him .
what do you think the cat ?
do you think that cat looks happy ?
he looks mad .
the cat didn't want to get caught did he !
i think the little boy likes the cat too .
and the lady's sh ?
huh .
uh oh .
what happened ?
he's falling down ?
crash ?
the whole tree broke i think .
look here .
you can see where it breaks .
and now the man's falling down out of the tree .
oh and that poor .
what's the cat so unhappy about ?
the cat's alright .
oh and here's the here's the boy going home on the in the baby buggy .
and the policeman's limping home ?
and the cat's just following right along behind him .
and then here's the lady ?
and she's telling them something .
i wonder what she's saying to them there .
maybe she's saying ?
if you guys will wait here patiently i'll go get you some ah chocolate chip cookies and milk ?
think that's what she's saying !
she did .
that's exactly what she said charlie .
look there's milk and chocolate chip cookies .

because what was his dad doing that was pretty cool .

how did you get up to the top there ?
um hm you took an elevator yeah .

does he know what that means .
did it go around and around matty .
the top part that you were at .
no .
i don't know .
but it was a tall thing so that's right though that's what i was thinking you took an elevator to get there .
there was a couple elevators .
um well we're gonna go up up up in the sears tower for sure .
you know how many i should tell you how many days until we go there actually it might be very interesting .
today's friday okay .
so we got saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday ?

well we are actually leaving for grandma sharon and grandpa dale in three days .
monday and then on wednesday we'll probably go to the sears tower .
are you excited for christmas .
what did you ask for ?
oh a remote control car .
just anything ?
remote control .
so i don't really remember hearing too much about that particular thing .
was there anything else you wanted ?
there is one thing that i know you wanted but um but then you said that somebody else at school was gonna get it for you .
do you remember what that was ?
what is it ?
barbie of swan lake movie yes .

oh ?
but i actually remember i was gonna buy you a dvd too ?
i'll give you a hint it starts with a w ?
wil .
willy .
we love that one .
that is a good movie ?
so that is a good movie .
did you have you ever seen that movie .
uh uh .
oh my goodness you gotta tell her .
what happens in willy wonka and the chocolate factory ?
oh wow .
do they get to eat chocolate .
wow .
one kid remember he tried to have too much chocolate what happened to him .
agustus .
um hm .
there was this whole river made out of chocolate and he was drinking it right ?
yep .
what happened to that one girl that was very spoiled ?
yeah what is she asking for .
do you remember what she was asking for ?
um hm .
what happened to charlie ?
nothing ?
what happened to mike t v ?
what happened to mike t v ?
um hm .
that's right he wanted to be the first person to travel by t v waves right .
remember he was floating all above them in little tiny pieces .
and then he showed up on the t v screen ?
um hm .
but you know carey is right about something something happens to charlie and grandpa joe ?
how did they almost get hurt ?
yeah .
how did that happened ?
do you know what was funny ?
how did they get down ?
burped all the way down .
and there were bubbles huh .
yeah .
good movie .
yep that's a really really good movie .
then i'm trying to remember so we talked about what happened on mike t v agustus glue ah what happened to that one girl who ate the gum .
violet .
and what did the umpa lumpas do to her ?
aha .
did they role her away .
do you remember ?
yeah that was funny .
yeah you're right though they had to take her to the juicer room .
it's totally funny ?
what song did they sing ?
do you remember it ?
how does it go ?
it is !
good memory .
i don't remember much about the rest of the song because they have a little different songs for each of the different kids right .
um hm .
so this is this is a very interesting part of the movie to me because at the end of it remember he first told charlie that he lost ?
um hm and then he said you win but what you know what this is funny what's the part of the movie that could never really happen ?
like what's the deal with grandpa joe and the bed .
yep he just got up and danced didn't he ?
that could never happen right .
that was totally funny .
so anyway yeah so that's one of the gifts that i got you remember .
you're gonna get to open it so you can take it on the trip .
i got it with when i was with daddy same day .
we had a good time at walmart .
we all kinds of stuff that day .
what do you remember did daddy tell you what we're gonna go do tonight ?

oh my goodness that is beautiful where'd you get that ?
oh my goodness you totally found it you must have been so excited that you found it again .
yeah ?
um can i see it ?
i won't loose it ?
that was a smart idea to wrap it up in there .
oh it's beautiful ?
is that a bead ?
um hm .
you know what it looks like to me .
doesn't it look quite a bit like a diamond .
wow ?
he is like give it back .
maybe what you know maybe it is a diamond ?
how do you know maybe it truly is a diamond ?
yeah to be able to put it on a ring or in a necklace or something .
do you know do you know where diamonds come from ?
compressed charcoal .
do you know what that means ?
over a long period of time charcoal gets pushed down by the earth and then it forms into diamonds and crystalizes ?
pretty cool huh .
go tell roman that ?
roman is really funny .
you didn't see him today but we saw him yesterday at gymnastics right .
yes believe it or not guess what he's gonna do tomorrow night .
what were we talking about this morning ?
oh wow ?
talk about what what you guys might do .
what would you like to do with roman and sophie ?
play what ?
play shoots and ladders .
yes that's a very fun game definitely a fun game ?
anything else .
and candy land too yes ?
where ?
oh i just didn't know where you were going ?
oh that reminds me though ?
what did we forget to bring back today ?
uh oh .
we have another car that we borrowed yes ?
that's okay .
yes .
we trust you ?
we took it out we just totally forgot to bring it back though .
yeah .
so i was thinking about hm well do you know about our what we're gonna do on our trip matty ?
well you know we're gonna go to the sears towers right ?
and we're gonna go grandma sharon and grandpa dale's .
we're gonna go to the museum .
which museum ?
oh the dinosaur museum .
why don't you come over here honey ?
i can't see you or hear you .
you can play with the car at the end ?
the dinosaur museum yes .
that is totally cool .
what do you think that they'll have there ?
yeah ?
i bet you're right what else do they tend to have at those kind of museums .
what ?
well sometimes they have animals that are like dead right ?
not just the bones but the whole animal right ?
yeah so you can see what the animals look like ?
it's almost like a zoo kinda right .
except ?
when they try to you know they set up the dioramas and displays and stuff ?
yep .
in their little natural habitats ?
but you had an idea he was so funny remember matty you said how many days are we gonna be at grandma sharon's and grandpa dales and i said four and he said well that should be enough days because he wanted to go to my parents actually live an hour and a half from chicago .
um hm .
so he was like well that will give us three days one day to go to sears towers right one day to go to the dinosaur museum and what was the other place you wanted to go ?
oh you don't remember !
hm you went there this summer with daddy and you and daddy had a really good time .
you still don't remember .
let me give you a hint ?
oh now you remember okay what .
oh wow .
aquarium but we decided we probably will only go to chicago one one day .
sears towers and dinosaur museum right .
in one day ?
it's gonna be a long day right ?
yeah .
yeah .
and then also on the trip you're gonna go visit ?
grandma and grandpa .
yes ?
what do you think you'll do there ?
are you gonna eat ?
what will you have ?
what's your favorite food ?
you say that ?
i think that's probably true you tend to choose those a lot ?
or noodles you tend to like curly noodles cheesy noodles right .
pizza .
i know what i would say your favorite food is .
i gonna have a new guess ?
okay and then tell me which one truly is your favorite .
could it possibly be mozzarella sticks cheese sticks ?
do you like those better than chicken nuggets or you like chicken nuggets better ?
which one do you eat more ?
um more recently you probably eat the cheese sticks a little bit more often .
cheese sticks ?
so at grandma grandma and grandpa zevenburgen's we don't do that many specific things .
we tend to just visit ?
because there's lots of family there right .
cody and kaylia and heidi and the new baby and and then jaden right .
yeah they probably don't know who jaden is though .
who is jaden ?
you forget .
because you haven't seen here in a long time that's true probably ?
you know what .
i just was thinking it might actually be two years since you've seen jaden ?
whoa that is a long time honey ?
that's amazing .
i could be right though yeah ?
anyway that's his cousin but we don't really see them because cody and kaylia they came with us .

but if you had had the yellow stick still .
bed early .

rows of seats to sit on so that people can listen to people talk .
look inside of the church and in some churches and synagogues there are beautiful stained glass windows .
there's a part inside of a church .
there is god in the church ?
well .
god is inside of the people who think about him when they go to church .
the church is a special place for them to go and think about ?
well .
there are some people who believe that .
yes .
it's very confusing about god .
i don't understand very well about god myself .
about god ?
yeah .
i i have trouble explaining it to you laura ?
because i don't know the answer !
i don't think daddy knows the answer about god either .
maybe .
what what would you like to know and maybe i can help you ?
who ?
oh .
what ?
people meet together to talk and to sing and to celebrate thinking about god but they can't really see him ?
he's not something that we can see ?
he's something that we can talk about and think about but he's not something that we can put our hands on and touch and see ?
well .
i have never heard him talk .
maybe .
that's possible that he's an invisible person .
that's true .
maybe he could what .
yes .
but invisible things can move around .
that's right .
that's right .
maybe he's right here in this room and we can't see him or hear him or smell him or hear him .
well .
yeah .
i'm not invisible am i .
and i could love you too .
maybe we'd better .
well .
we can talk about it .
i don't mind talking about it .
you don't wanna or you do wanna .
oh .
well ?
we're not gonna listen to this .
her ding dongs sounded a bit squeaky but cheeky didn't mind .
she loved to sing .
just then a little bird flew down onto the window sill .
tweet .
tweet he sang .
tweet .
tweet .
cheeky blew her whistle .
the little bird didn't wait to hear her song .
he flew away but cheeky didn't mind .
while she combed her hair she remembered another way to make music .
by a comb .
that's right .
she put a piece of paper over her comb then she hummed through it's teeth .
she loved the tingling music even though it made her shiver .
downstairs the tea kettle was whistling .
cheeky whistled too .
her whistle was as loud as a dozen tea kettles ?
at breakfast cheeky used her spoon to tap a tune on her milk glass .
on her plate .
on the sugar bowl and on the coffee pot .
each time she made a different up and down musical sound .
please kiki .
not so much noise at the breakfast table said daddy ?
kiki stopped ?
she couldn't understand why daddy didn't like her music ?
huh ?
too loud .
yeah .
after breakfast she decided to have a concert with muffy her cat but muffy doesn't care about music either .
why doesn't muffy like that music .
i don't either .
it must not be very good music .
he ran away when kiki tried to blow her horn and beat her drum at the same time .
after her nap kiki still wanted music .
she and her playmates were having a fine concert ?
boom .
boom .
screech .
screech .
toot .
toot .
it sounded wonderful to kiki .
but when daddy came home to put his hands over his ears .
excuse me .
but when daddy came home he put his hands over his ears .
what a noise he cried .
it's time kiki learns the difference between music and noise .
she is big enough to learn to play real music .
so the next day daddy and kiki went to the music store ?
first the man in the store showed kiki the small violin .
squeak went the bow across the string .
not this one said kiki .
next she tried a cello .
it was too tall .
you make a cello noise .
you know the cello .
the tuba was too big and too hard to blow .
that's the tuba .
right .
the harp was beautiful but it looked big too .
no .
you're not bigger than a harp is .
a harp is even bigger than i am .
it's a very large instrument .
perhaps .
that's the one you're gonna choose is the harp .
well .
i don't know .
we'll have trouble finding you a teacher to help you learn how to play the harp laura .
that's a very unusual instrument .
maybe they do have a good child harp .
i don't know .
then the then the music man store .
excuse me .
then the music store man played pop goes the weasel on the piano .
that's right .
that's what it says .
so she didn't think a piano was a bit too big .
piano was what she wanted most of all .
then they picked out a piano that was just the right size for kiki .
on the way home kiki and daddy did the hurdy gurdy dance ?
oh daddy ?
that would be fun to play too kiki said .
a piano will be enough said daddy .
kiki's piano came in a big truck .
she wanted to play so she banged on the keys .
she tried sitting on the stool .
she tried standing up to reach the pedals but no tune came out .
just noise .
the next day miss dingle came to teach kiki how to play the piano .
she showed her where to put her fingers on the keyboard and how to play notes .
kiki thought it was hard to use all her fingers .
she wanted to use just one finger and play pop goes the weasel .
finally mother said kiki let's have a surprise .
if you will try to use all your fingers i will try to teach you a song for a very special day that is coming soon .
kiki loved the idea of a surprise .
happy birthday dear daddy .

most of all what nomi .
oh okay .
okay nomi .
we've got everything working .
what are you doing with the sponge ?
i don't think you'd better do that nomi because you splash it over .
no no no no .
we can't have any splashing out of the tub because that man's coming to put the tile on the floor and he can't work on a wet floor .
don't drop it please .
oh nomi whoops !
oh don't .
oh boy .
because you're getting all that stuff into the tub .
well because that's not where it belongs .
if it's in the tub now it's gonna get in your hair later on .
let me see if i can clear some of that out .
are you warm enough in there naomi ?
well i guess there's nothing you can do about that .
naomi tell me about the summer again .
i'd like to hear what your .
well what you want to do in the summer ?

mhm .
what happened when your teachers yelled at you ?
you didn't pay any attention to them ?
naomi don't splash .
you just kept right on walking slowly up the hill ?
you walked slowlyer ?
it's on .
you can speak right now .
we've been speaking into it all this time .
oh no you can't hold it naomi .
not when you're in the tub .
that's dangerous .
that can naomi for the same reason naomi that you can't play with plugs .
didn't you hear it before when we played it back ?
okay .
well i'm going to put some more hot water in the tub and we'll play it back .
and you can listen to your voice while the hot water runs into the tub .
okay .
i've put the tape recorder on again .
nomi tell me what happened on the way home today when you were riding in the car with jacqueline and there was somebody on a bicycle .
do you remember how you said that ?
when you were in the car ?
i think in the car she had said .
if we were we would have .
can you finish it ?
we would have .
oh somebody's at the door .
you talk into the tape recorder for a minute while i get the door .
nomi's in the tub .
mhm .
how did you get that scratch ?
never did hurt very much did it ?
you want what ?
well that was all there was nomi .
well i'm afraid we've erased that part now .
well there's no way of getting that any more because we're tape recording over it .
what else would you like to talk about ?
do you want to tell me another story ?
make up another story ?
it'd be nice .
tell me a story nomi .
okay .
sure .
now you have to speak clearly naomi .
nomi remember the tape recorder has trouble understanding so you have to speak clearly for the tape recorder .
no it listens .
it just listens .
sometimes it talks .
i guess when it plays back it talks doesn't it ?
and what about naomi ?
oh well maybe she's with the pineapple .
where is she ?
i don't see her .
and who are you pointing to ?
don't pick at those nomi please .
wallpaper fell off the pillow ?
put meatballs on them ?
and did what ?
even on the toilet paper .
nomi it'd be good if you came down to this side of the tub where the microphone is .
it had a funny shaped body ?
oh for a poo poo .
and it lived happily ever after ?
are you ready to get you hair washed now ?
we'll turn this off while you get your hair washed .
what do you want to say now ?
okay one more story and then you come out of the tub .
mhm .
can i throw this out naomi ?
i'm not understanding any of this either if you're having trouble transcribing .
remember nomi um if you wanna record you have to just talk would be better because it's awfully hard to understand .
it doesn't help that she's got a bit of a head cold .
nomi why don't you tell us tell us what you're doing with the frog .
why is it hopping ?
where is it going ?
it doesn't know where ?
i see .
she's got the frog's leg through the fish eye .
naomi i'd like you to say some to say a sentence .
first the way you would say it and then the way some other people would say the same thing .
let's say how about .
it's time for a bath tonight .
you say that just the way you would say it .
okay now say it the way jacqueline would say it .
say it the way i would say it .
how would a baby say it ?
how would a boy say it ?
how would a girl say it ?
how would a man say it ?
how would a woman say it ?
okay nomi in two minutes you'll come out of the tub .
i guess that was the water running out of it .
if fish get out of the water ?
yes .
naomi time now to come out of the tub .
if you want dessert and time to play upstairs you have to come out now .
you can just leave the water in there and it'll come out .
when frogs get in the water nomi they get water inside them ?
adam do you want to hang up the clothes line ?

adam's taller .
oh no you won't want any dinner .
i'd like to sit in this chair if it's alright with you .

maybe one end could go on the drawer .
where're you going to tie the other end ?
you can tie it go ahead .
if you can't tie it maybe robin can tie it .
alright .
ursula brought it for adam to play with .
alright .
let me see if there's something you can hang in the box .
your line is slipping down .

could i have another page ?
i thought you said you could read it .

well you gave them to me .
and then i gave them back to you .
now you can give them to robin and he can give them to his mother and we'll both have flowers .
i'll give them back now adam .
where's the box ?
that's not a box .
it's supposed to be a case .
what ?
well then i guess the nurses would have to take care of people .
well we really would have quite a few sick people .
then maybe each person would have to take care of himself .
alright .
don't take his things adam .
here you are adam .
you can't even what ?
they're cotton balls .
for cleaning things .
if you have a hurt or scratch or cut you can clean it with a ball of cotton .
diandra why are you tearing it up ?
that's right .
what time is it adam ?
oh dear .
maybe you should keep the things we want to keep away from there .
diandra no .
you're tearing up too much .
that wouldn't be nice to do .
would you like for me to leave you down here without any dinner ?

oh it looks much better ?
it really does .
you're really getting well .
okay let's get your socks on .
you scratch it with your finger .

hopping on one foot .
oh that does look hard .
let me see if i can do it .
oh yeah oh it's too hard .
tricky .
oh you've really got to be able to balance awhile doncha ?

but just even to be able to hop on one holding one foot like that is really good .
okay ?
i think he's back getting dressed .
you want to hold the microphone .
okay you can hold it just try not to move around too much .
now you want to say something special into it .
is that what you did the other day at school when you recorded ?
did you hold the microphone .
or was the microphone on the table .
or did louise hold the microphone ?
oh .
did it make you feel shy to have the microphone in front of your face ?
did it make you shy to have louise there .
no oh that's good .
because you'd met louise before huh .

yeah as soon as i get your hair done .
well i think it won't record if you don't ?
we don't want to have one side of your hair with no more tangles and the other side not have because then you'd have one tangles side and that would be silly wouldn't it .
and we'd keep wondering hm why is one side of your hair all tangled and the other side nice and smooth ?
you're gonna what .
okay .
okay wanna listen to what it sounds like now .
